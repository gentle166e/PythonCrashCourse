CHAPTER I.
Down the Rabbit-Hole


Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into
the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
conversations in it, 鈥渁nd what is the use of a book,鈥� thought Alice
鈥渨ithout pictures or conversations?鈥�

So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of
making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
close by her.

There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it
so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 鈥淥h
dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!鈥� (when she thought it over afterwards,
it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the
time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a
watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried
on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she
had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a
watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the
field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a
large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how
in the world she was to get out again.

The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very
deep well.

Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what
was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out
what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she
looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with
cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures
hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she
passed; it was labelled 鈥淥RANGE MARMALADE鈥�, but to her great
disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear
of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the
cupboards as she fell past it.

鈥淲ell!鈥� thought Alice to herself, 鈥渁fter such a fall as this, I shall
think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they鈥檒l all think me
at home! Why, I wouldn鈥檛 say anything about it, even if I fell off the
top of the house!鈥� (Which was very likely true.)

Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? 鈥淚 wonder how
many miles I鈥檝e fallen by this time?鈥� she said aloud. 鈥淚 must be
getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would
be four thousand miles down, I think鈥斺€� (for, you see, Alice had learnt
several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and
though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her
knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good
practice to say it over) 鈥溾€攜es, that鈥檚 about the right distance鈥攂ut
then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I鈥檝e got to?鈥� (Alice had no
idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice
grand words to say.)

Presently she began again. 鈥淚 wonder if I shall fall right _through_
the earth! How funny it鈥檒l seem to come out among the people that walk
with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think鈥斺€� (she was rather
glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn鈥檛 sound at all
the right word) 鈥溾€攂ut I shall have to ask them what the name of the
country is, you know. Please, Ma鈥檃m, is this New Zealand or Australia?鈥�
(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke鈥攆ancy _curtseying_ as you鈥檙e
falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) 鈥淎nd what
an ignorant little girl she鈥檒l think me for asking! No, it鈥檒l never do
to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.鈥�

Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began
talking again. 鈥淒inah鈥檒l miss me very much to-night, I should think!鈥�
(Dinah was the cat.) 鈥淚 hope they鈥檒l remember her saucer of milk at
tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are
no mice in the air, I鈥檓 afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that鈥檚
very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?鈥� And here
Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a
dreamy sort of way, 鈥淒o cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?鈥� and
sometimes, 鈥淒o bats eat cats?鈥� for, you see, as she couldn鈥檛 answer
either question, it didn鈥檛 much matter which way she put it. She felt
that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was
walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,
鈥淣ow, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?鈥� when suddenly,
thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and
the fall was over.

Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:
she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another
long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down
it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,
and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 鈥淥h my ears
and whiskers, how late it鈥檚 getting!鈥� She was close behind it when she
turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found
herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging
from the roof.

There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when
Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every
door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to
get out again.

Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid
glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice鈥檚
first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;
but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,
but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second
time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and
behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the
little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!

Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not
much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the
passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get
out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright
flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head
through the doorway; 鈥渁nd even if my head would go through,鈥� thought
poor Alice, 鈥渋t would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,
how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only
knew how to begin.鈥� For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had
happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things
indeed were really impossible.

There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went
back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at
any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this
time she found a little bottle on it, (鈥渨hich certainly was not here
before,鈥� said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper
label, with the words 鈥淒RINK ME,鈥� beautifully printed on it in large
letters.

It was all very well to say 鈥淒rink me,鈥� but the wise little Alice was
not going to do _that_ in a hurry. 鈥淣o, I鈥檒l look first,鈥� she said,
鈥渁nd see whether it鈥檚 marked 鈥榑poison_鈥� or not鈥�; for she had read
several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and
eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they
_would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:
such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;
and that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually
bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a
bottle marked 鈥減oison,鈥� it is almost certain to disagree with you,
sooner or later.

However, this bottle was _not_ marked 鈥減oison,鈥� so Alice ventured to
taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed
flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and
hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.

*      *      *      *      *      *      *

    *      *      *      *      *      *

*      *      *      *      *      *      *


鈥淲hat a curious feeling!鈥� said Alice; 鈥淚 must be shutting up like a
telescope.鈥�

And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face
brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going
through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she
waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:
she felt a little nervous about this; 鈥渇or it might end, you know,鈥�
said Alice to herself, 鈥渋n my going out altogether, like a candle. I
wonder what I should be like then?鈥� And she tried to fancy what the
flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could
not remember ever having seen such a thing.

After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going
into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the
door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she
went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach
it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her
best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;
and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing
sat down and cried.

鈥淐ome, there鈥檚 no use in crying like that!鈥� said Alice to herself,
rather sharply; 鈥淚 advise you to leave off this minute!鈥� She generally
gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),
and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into
her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having
cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,
for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.
鈥淏ut it鈥檚 no use now,鈥� thought poor Alice, 鈥渢o pretend to be two
people! Why, there鈥檚 hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable
person!鈥�

Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:
she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words
鈥淓AT ME鈥� were beautifully marked in currants. 鈥淲ell, I鈥檒l eat it,鈥� said
Alice, 鈥渁nd if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it
makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I鈥檒l
get into the garden, and I don鈥檛 care which happens!鈥�

She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, 鈥淲hich way? Which
way?鈥�, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was
growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same
size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice
had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way
things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go
on in the common way.

So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.

*      *      *      *      *      *      *

    *      *      *      *      *      *

*      *      *      *      *      *      *




CHAPTER II.
The Pool of Tears


鈥淐uriouser and curiouser!鈥� cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that
for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); 鈥渘ow I鈥檓
opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!鈥�
(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of
sight, they were getting so far off). 鈥淥h, my poor little feet, I
wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I鈥檓
sure _I_ shan鈥檛 be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble
myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;鈥攂ut I must be
kind to them,鈥� thought Alice, 鈥渙r perhaps they won鈥檛 walk the way I
want to go! Let me see: I鈥檒l give them a new pair of boots every
Christmas.鈥�

And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. 鈥淭hey must
go by the carrier,鈥� she thought; 鈥渁nd how funny it鈥檒l seem, sending
presents to one鈥檚 own feet! And how odd the directions will look!

     _Alice鈥檚 Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with
     Alice鈥檚 love_).

Oh dear, what nonsense I鈥檓 talking!鈥�

Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was
now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden
key and hurried off to the garden door.

Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to
look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more
hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.

鈥淵ou ought to be ashamed of yourself,鈥� said Alice, 鈥渁 great girl like
you,鈥� (she might well say this), 鈥渢o go on crying in this way! Stop
this moment, I tell you!鈥� But she went on all the same, shedding
gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about
four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.

After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and
she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White
Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves
in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a
great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, 鈥淥h! the Duchess, the
Duchess! Oh! won鈥檛 she be savage if I鈥檝e kept her waiting!鈥� Alice felt
so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the
Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, 鈥淚f you please,
sir鈥斺€� The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and
the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.

Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she
kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: 鈥淒ear, dear! How
queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.
I wonder if I鈥檝e been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the
same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling
a little different. But if I鈥檓 not the same, the next question is, Who
in the world am I? Ah, _that鈥檚_ the great puzzle!鈥� And she began
thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as
herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.

鈥淚鈥檓 sure I鈥檓 not Ada,鈥� she said, 鈥渇or her hair goes in such long
ringlets, and mine doesn鈥檛 go in ringlets at all; and I鈥檓 sure I can鈥檛
be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a
very little! Besides, _she鈥檚_ she, and _I鈥檓_ I, and鈥攐h dear, how
puzzling it all is! I鈥檒l try if I know all the things I used to know.
Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,
and four times seven is鈥攐h dear! I shall never get to twenty at that
rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn鈥檛 signify: let鈥檚 try
Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of
Rome, and Rome鈥攏o, _that鈥檚_ all wrong, I鈥檓 certain! I must have been
changed for Mabel! I鈥檒l try and say 鈥榑How doth the little_鈥斺€欌€� and she
crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began
to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words
did not come the same as they used to do:鈥�

鈥淗ow doth the little crocodile
    Improve his shining tail,
And pour the waters of the Nile
    On every golden scale!

鈥淗ow cheerfully he seems to grin,
    How neatly spread his claws,
And welcome little fishes in
    With gently smiling jaws!鈥�


鈥淚鈥檓 sure those are not the right words,鈥� said poor Alice, and her eyes
filled with tears again as she went on, 鈥淚 must be Mabel after all, and
I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to
no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I鈥檝e
made up my mind about it; if I鈥檓 Mabel, I鈥檒l stay down here! It鈥檒l be
no use their putting their heads down and saying 鈥楥ome up again, dear!鈥�
I shall only look up and say 鈥榃ho am I then? Tell me that first, and
then, if I like being that person, I鈥檒l come up: if not, I鈥檒l stay down
here till I鈥檓 somebody else鈥欌€攂ut, oh dear!鈥� cried Alice, with a sudden
burst of tears, 鈥淚 do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so
_very_ tired of being all alone here!鈥�

As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see
that she had put on one of the Rabbit鈥檚 little white kid gloves while
she was talking. 鈥淗ow _can_ I have done that?鈥� she thought. 鈥淚 must be
growing small again.鈥� She got up and went to the table to measure
herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was
now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon
found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she
dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.

鈥淭hat _was_ a narrow escape!鈥� said Alice, a good deal frightened at the
sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; 鈥渁nd
now for the garden!鈥� and she ran with all speed back to the little
door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden
key was lying on the glass table as before, 鈥渁nd things are worse than
ever,鈥� thought the poor child, 鈥渇or I never was so small as this
before, never! And I declare it鈥檚 too bad, that it is!鈥�

As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,
splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that
she had somehow fallen into the sea, 鈥渁nd in that case I can go back by
railway,鈥� she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in
her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go
to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the
sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row
of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she
soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when
she was nine feet high.

鈥淚 wish I hadn鈥檛 cried so much!鈥� said Alice, as she swam about, trying
to find her way out. 鈥淚 shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by
being drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be
sure! However, everything is queer to-day.鈥�

Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way
off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought
it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small
she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had
slipped in like herself.

鈥淲ould it be of any use, now,鈥� thought Alice, 鈥渢o speak to this mouse?
Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very
likely it can talk: at any rate, there鈥檚 no harm in trying.鈥� So she
began: 鈥淥 Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired
of swimming about here, O Mouse!鈥� (Alice thought this must be the right
way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but
she remembered having seen in her brother鈥檚 Latin Grammar, 鈥淎 mouse鈥攐f
a mouse鈥攖o a mouse鈥攁 mouse鈥擮 mouse!鈥�) The Mouse looked at her rather
inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,
but it said nothing.

鈥淧erhaps it doesn鈥檛 understand English,鈥� thought Alice; 鈥淚 daresay it鈥檚
a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.鈥� (For, with all
her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago
anything had happened.) So she began again: 鈥淥霉 est ma chatte?鈥� which
was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a
sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with
fright. 鈥淥h, I beg your pardon!鈥� cried Alice hastily, afraid that she
had hurt the poor animal鈥檚 feelings. 鈥淚 quite forgot you didn鈥檛 like
cats.鈥�

鈥淣ot like cats!鈥� cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. 鈥淲ould
_you_ like cats if you were me?鈥�

鈥淲ell, perhaps not,鈥� said Alice in a soothing tone: 鈥渄on鈥檛 be angry
about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you鈥檇
take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear
quiet thing,鈥� Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about
in the pool, 鈥渁nd she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her
paws and washing her face鈥攁nd she is such a nice soft thing to
nurse鈥攁nd she鈥檚 such a capital one for catching mice鈥攐h, I beg your
pardon!鈥� cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all
over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. 鈥淲e won鈥檛 talk
about her any more if you鈥檇 rather not.鈥�

鈥淲e indeed!鈥� cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his
tail. 鈥淎s if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always
_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don鈥檛 let me hear the name
again!鈥�

鈥淚 won鈥檛 indeed!鈥� said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of
conversation. 鈥淎re you鈥攁re you fond鈥攐f鈥攐f dogs?鈥� The Mouse did not
answer, so Alice went on eagerly: 鈥淭here is such a nice little dog near
our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you
know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it鈥檒l fetch things when
you throw them, and it鈥檒l sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts
of things鈥擨 can鈥檛 remember half of them鈥攁nd it belongs to a farmer, you
know, and he says it鈥檚 so useful, it鈥檚 worth a hundred pounds! He says
it kills all the rats and鈥攐h dear!鈥� cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,
鈥淚鈥檓 afraid I鈥檝e offended it again!鈥� For the Mouse was swimming away
from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the
pool as it went.

So she called softly after it, 鈥淢ouse dear! Do come back again, and we
won鈥檛 talk about cats or dogs either, if you don鈥檛 like them!鈥� When the
Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face
was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low
trembling voice, 鈥淟et us get to the shore, and then I鈥檒l tell you my
history, and you鈥檒l understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.鈥�

It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the
birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a
Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice
led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.




CHAPTER III.
A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale


They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank鈥攖he
birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close
to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.

The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a
consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite
natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if
she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument
with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, 鈥淚 am
older than you, and must know better;鈥� and this Alice would not allow
without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to
tell its age, there was no more to be said.

At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,
called out, 鈥淪it down, all of you, and listen to me! _I鈥檒l_ soon make
you dry enough!鈥� They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the
Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she
felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.

鈥淎hem!鈥� said the Mouse with an important air, 鈥渁re you all ready? This
is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! 鈥榃illiam
the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted
to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much
accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of
Mercia and Northumbria鈥斺€欌€�

鈥淯gh!鈥� said the Lory, with a shiver.

鈥淚 beg your pardon!鈥� said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: 鈥淒id
you speak?鈥�

鈥淣ot I!鈥� said the Lory hastily.

鈥淚 thought you did,鈥� said the Mouse. 鈥溾€擨 proceed. 鈥楨dwin and Morcar,
the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even
Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable鈥斺€欌€�

鈥淔ound _what_?鈥� said the Duck.

鈥淔ound _it_,鈥� the Mouse replied rather crossly: 鈥渙f course you know
what 鈥榠t鈥� means.鈥�

鈥淚 know what 鈥榠t鈥� means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,鈥� said the
Duck: 鈥渋t鈥檚 generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the
archbishop find?鈥�

The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, 鈥溾€樷€攆ound
it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him
the crown. William鈥檚 conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence
of his Normans鈥斺€� How are you getting on now, my dear?鈥� it continued,
turning to Alice as it spoke.

鈥淎s wet as ever,鈥� said Alice in a melancholy tone: 鈥渋t doesn鈥檛 seem to
dry me at all.鈥�

鈥淚n that case,鈥� said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, 鈥淚 move
that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic
remedies鈥斺€�

鈥淪peak English!鈥� said the Eaglet. 鈥淚 don鈥檛 know the meaning of half
those long words, and, what鈥檚 more, I don鈥檛 believe you do either!鈥� And
the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds
tittered audibly.

鈥淲hat I was going to say,鈥� said the Dodo in an offended tone, 鈥渨as,
that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.鈥�

鈥淲hat _is_ a Caucus-race?鈥� said Alice; not that she wanted much to
know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to
speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.

鈥淲hy,鈥� said the Dodo, 鈥渢he best way to explain it is to do it.鈥� (And,
as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will
tell you how the Dodo managed it.)

First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (鈥渢he exact
shape doesn鈥檛 matter,鈥� it said,) and then all the party were placed
along the course, here and there. There was no 鈥淥ne, two, three, and
away,鈥� but they began running when they liked, and left off when they
liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,
when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry
again, the Dodo suddenly called out 鈥淭he race is over!鈥� and they all
crowded round it, panting, and asking, 鈥淏ut who has won?鈥�

This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of
thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its
forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the
pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo
said, 鈥淿Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.鈥�

鈥淏ut who is to give the prizes?鈥� quite a chorus of voices asked.

鈥淲hy, _she_, of course,鈥� said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one
finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a
confused way, 鈥淧rizes! Prizes!鈥�

Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her
pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had
not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly
one a-piece, all round.

鈥淏ut she must have a prize herself, you know,鈥� said the Mouse.

鈥淥f course,鈥� the Dodo replied very gravely. 鈥淲hat else have you got in
your pocket?鈥� he went on, turning to Alice.

鈥淥nly a thimble,鈥� said Alice sadly.

鈥淗and it over here,鈥� said the Dodo.

Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly
presented the thimble, saying 鈥淲e beg your acceptance of this elegant
thimble;鈥� and, when it had finished this short speech, they all
cheered.

Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave
that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything
to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as
she could.

The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and
confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste
theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.
However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and
begged the Mouse to tell them something more.

鈥淵ou promised to tell me your history, you know,鈥� said Alice, 鈥渁nd why
it is you hate鈥擟 and D,鈥� she added in a whisper, half afraid that it
would be offended again.

鈥淢ine is a long and a sad tale!鈥� said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and
sighing.

鈥淚t _is_ a long tail, certainly,鈥� said Alice, looking down with wonder
at the Mouse鈥檚 tail; 鈥渂ut why do you call it sad?鈥� And she kept on
puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the
tale was something like this:鈥�

         鈥淔ury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, 鈥楲et us both
         go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.鈥擟ome, I鈥檒l take no
         denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I鈥檝e
         nothing to do.鈥� Said the mouse to the cur, 鈥楽uch a trial, dear
         sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.鈥�
         鈥業鈥檒l be judge, I鈥檒l be jury,鈥� Said cunning old Fury: 鈥業鈥檒l
         try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.鈥欌€�

鈥淵ou are not attending!鈥� said the Mouse to Alice severely. 鈥淲hat are
you thinking of?鈥�

鈥淚 beg your pardon,鈥� said Alice very humbly: 鈥測ou had got to the fifth
bend, I think?鈥�

鈥淚 had _not!_鈥� cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.

鈥淎 knot!鈥� said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking
anxiously about her. 鈥淥h, do let me help to undo it!鈥�

鈥淚 shall do nothing of the sort,鈥� said the Mouse, getting up and
walking away. 鈥淵ou insult me by talking such nonsense!鈥�

鈥淚 didn鈥檛 mean it!鈥� pleaded poor Alice. 鈥淏ut you鈥檙e so easily offended,
you know!鈥�

The Mouse only growled in reply.

鈥淧lease come back and finish your story!鈥� Alice called after it; and
the others all joined in chorus, 鈥淵es, please do!鈥� but the Mouse only
shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.

鈥淲hat a pity it wouldn鈥檛 stay!鈥� sighed the Lory, as soon as it was
quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to
her daughter 鈥淎h, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose
_your_ temper!鈥� 鈥淗old your tongue, Ma!鈥� said the young Crab, a little
snappishly. 鈥淵ou鈥檙e enough to try the patience of an oyster!鈥�

鈥淚 wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!鈥� said Alice aloud,
addressing nobody in particular. 鈥淪he鈥檇 soon fetch it back!鈥�

鈥淎nd who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?鈥� said the
Lory.

Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:
鈥淒inah鈥檚 our cat. And she鈥檚 such a capital one for catching mice you
can鈥檛 think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,
she鈥檒l eat a little bird as soon as look at it!鈥�

This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the
birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very
carefully, remarking, 鈥淚 really must be getting home; the night-air
doesn鈥檛 suit my throat!鈥� and a Canary called out in a trembling voice
to its children, 鈥淐ome away, my dears! It鈥檚 high time you were all in
bed!鈥� On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left
alone.

鈥淚 wish I hadn鈥檛 mentioned Dinah!鈥� she said to herself in a melancholy
tone. 鈥淣obody seems to like her, down here, and I鈥檓 sure she鈥檚 the best
cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you
any more!鈥� And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very
lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a
little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up
eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was
coming back to finish his story.




CHAPTER IV.
The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill


It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking
anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard
it muttering to itself 鈥淭he Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh
my fur and whiskers! She鈥檒l get me executed, as sure as ferrets are
ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?鈥� Alice guessed in a
moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid
gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but
they were nowhere to be seen鈥攅verything seemed to have changed since
her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the
little door, had vanished completely.

Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and
called out to her in an angry tone, 鈥淲hy, Mary Ann, what _are_ you
doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and
a fan! Quick, now!鈥� And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off
at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the
mistake it had made.

鈥淗e took me for his housemaid,鈥� she said to herself as she ran. 鈥淗ow
surprised he鈥檒l be when he finds out who I am! But I鈥檇 better take him
his fan and gloves鈥攖hat is, if I can find them.鈥� As she said this, she
came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass
plate with the name 鈥淲. RABBIT,鈥� engraved upon it. She went in without
knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the
real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the
fan and gloves.

鈥淗ow queer it seems,鈥� Alice said to herself, 鈥渢o be going messages for
a rabbit! I suppose Dinah鈥檒l be sending me on messages next!鈥� And she
began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: 鈥溾€楳iss Alice! Come
here directly, and get ready for your walk!鈥� 鈥楥oming in a minute,
nurse! But I鈥檝e got to see that the mouse doesn鈥檛 get out.鈥� Only I
don鈥檛 think,鈥� Alice went on, 鈥渢hat they鈥檇 let Dinah stop in the house
if it began ordering people about like that!鈥�

By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table
in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three
pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the
gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a
little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label
this time with the words 鈥淒RINK ME,鈥� but nevertheless she uncorked it
and put it to her lips. 鈥淚 know _something_ interesting is sure to
happen,鈥� she said to herself, 鈥渨henever I eat or drink anything; so
I鈥檒l just see what this bottle does. I do hope it鈥檒l make me grow large
again, for really I鈥檓 quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!鈥�

It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had
drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,
and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put
down the bottle, saying to herself 鈥淭hat鈥檚 quite enough鈥擨 hope I shan鈥檛
grow any more鈥擜s it is, I can鈥檛 get out at the door鈥擨 do wish I hadn鈥檛
drunk quite so much!鈥�

Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,
and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there
was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with
one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.
Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out
of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself 鈥淣ow I
can do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?鈥�

Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,
and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there
seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room
again, no wonder she felt unhappy.

鈥淚t was much pleasanter at home,鈥� thought poor Alice, 鈥渨hen one wasn鈥檛
always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and
rabbits. I almost wish I hadn鈥檛 gone down that rabbit-hole鈥攁nd yet鈥攁nd
yet鈥攊t鈥檚 rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what
_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied
that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of
one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And
when I grow up, I鈥檒l write one鈥攂ut I鈥檓 grown up now,鈥� she added in a
sorrowful tone; 鈥渁t least there鈥檚 no room to grow up any more _here_.鈥�

鈥淏ut then,鈥� thought Alice, 鈥渟hall I _never_ get any older than I am
now? That鈥檒l be a comfort, one way鈥攏ever to be an old woman鈥攂ut
then鈥攁lways to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn鈥檛 like _that!_鈥�

鈥淥h, you foolish Alice!鈥� she answered herself. 鈥淗ow can you learn
lessons in here? Why, there鈥檚 hardly room for _you_, and no room at all
for any lesson-books!鈥�

And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and
making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes
she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.

鈥淢ary Ann! Mary Ann!鈥� said the voice. 鈥淔etch me my gloves this moment!鈥�
Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was
the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the
house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as
large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.

Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as
the door opened inwards, and Alice鈥檚 elbow was pressed hard against it,
that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself 鈥淭hen I鈥檒l
go round and get in at the window.鈥�

鈥淿That_ you won鈥檛!鈥� thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied
she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her
hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,
but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,
from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a
cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.

Next came an angry voice鈥攖he Rabbit鈥檚鈥斺€淧at! Pat! Where are you?鈥� And
then a voice she had never heard before, 鈥淪ure then I鈥檓 here! Digging
for apples, yer honour!鈥�

鈥淒igging for apples, indeed!鈥� said the Rabbit angrily. 鈥淗ere! Come and
help me out of _this!_鈥� (Sounds of more broken glass.)

鈥淣ow tell me, Pat, what鈥檚 that in the window?鈥�

鈥淪ure, it鈥檚 an arm, yer honour!鈥� (He pronounced it 鈥渁rrum.鈥�)

鈥淎n arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole
window!鈥�

鈥淪ure, it does, yer honour: but it鈥檚 an arm for all that.鈥�

鈥淲ell, it鈥檚 got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!鈥�

There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers
now and then; such as, 鈥淪ure, I don鈥檛 like it, yer honour, at all, at
all!鈥� 鈥淒o as I tell you, you coward!鈥� and at last she spread out her
hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were
_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. 鈥淲hat a number
of cucumber-frames there must be!鈥� thought Alice. 鈥淚 wonder what
they鈥檒l do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they
_could!_ I鈥檓 sure _I_ don鈥檛 want to stay in here any longer!鈥�

She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a
rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all
talking together: she made out the words: 鈥淲here鈥檚 the other
ladder?鈥擶hy, I hadn鈥檛 to bring but one; Bill鈥檚 got the other鈥擝ill!
fetch it here, lad!鈥擧ere, put 鈥檈m up at this corner鈥擭o, tie 鈥檈m
together first鈥攖hey don鈥檛 reach half high enough yet鈥擮h! they鈥檒l do
well enough; don鈥檛 be particular鈥擧ere, Bill! catch hold of this
rope鈥擶ill the roof bear?鈥擬ind that loose slate鈥擮h, it鈥檚 coming down!
Heads below!鈥� (a loud crash)鈥斺€淣ow, who did that?鈥擨t was Bill, I
fancy鈥擶ho鈥檚 to go down the chimney?鈥擭ay, _I_ shan鈥檛! _You_ do
it!鈥擾That_ I won鈥檛, then!鈥擝ill鈥檚 to go down鈥擧ere, Bill! the master says
you鈥檙e to go down the chimney!鈥�

鈥淥h! So Bill鈥檚 got to come down the chimney, has he?鈥� said Alice to
herself. 鈥淪hy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn鈥檛 be in
Bill鈥檚 place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but
I _think_ I can kick a little!鈥�

She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till
she heard a little animal (she couldn鈥檛 guess of what sort it was)
scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,
saying to herself 鈥淭his is Bill,鈥� she gave one sharp kick, and waited
to see what would happen next.

The first thing she heard was a general chorus of 鈥淭here goes Bill!鈥�
then the Rabbit鈥檚 voice along鈥斺€淐atch him, you by the hedge!鈥� then
silence, and then another confusion of voices鈥斺€淗old up his head鈥擝randy
now鈥擠on鈥檛 choke him鈥擧ow was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell
us all about it!鈥�

Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (鈥淭hat鈥檚 Bill,鈥� thought
Alice,) 鈥淲ell, I hardly know鈥擭o more, thank ye; I鈥檓 better now鈥攂ut I鈥檓
a deal too flustered to tell you鈥攁ll I know is, something comes at me
like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!鈥�

鈥淪o you did, old fellow!鈥� said the others.

鈥淲e must burn the house down!鈥� said the Rabbit鈥檚 voice; and Alice
called out as loud as she could, 鈥淚f you do, I鈥檒l set Dinah at you!鈥�

There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, 鈥淚
wonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, they鈥檇 take the
roof off.鈥� After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and
Alice heard the Rabbit say, 鈥淎 barrowful will do, to begin with.鈥�

鈥淎 barrowful of _what?_鈥� thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,
for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the
window, and some of them hit her in the face. 鈥淚鈥檒l put a stop to
this,鈥� she said to herself, and shouted out, 鈥淵ou鈥檇 better not do that
again!鈥� which produced another dead silence.

Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into
little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her
head. 鈥淚f I eat one of these cakes,鈥� she thought, 鈥渋t鈥檚 sure to make
_some_ change in my size; and as it can鈥檛 possibly make me larger, it
must make me smaller, I suppose.鈥�

So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she
began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get
through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of
little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,
was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it
something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she
appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself
safe in a thick wood.

鈥淭he first thing I鈥檝e got to do,鈥� said Alice to herself, as she
wandered about in the wood, 鈥渋s to grow to my right size again; and the
second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that
will be the best plan.鈥�

It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply
arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea
how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among
the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a
great hurry.

An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and
feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. 鈥淧oor little
thing!鈥� said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to
it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it
might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in
spite of all her coaxing.

Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and
held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off
all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,
and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,
to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the
other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head
over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was
very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every
moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then
the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very
little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely
all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with
its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.

This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she
set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,
and till the puppy鈥檚 bark sounded quite faint in the distance.

鈥淎nd yet what a dear little puppy it was!鈥� said Alice, as she leant
against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the
leaves: 鈥淚 should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if鈥攊f I鈥檇
only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I鈥檇 nearly forgotten that
I鈥檝e got to grow up again! Let me see鈥攈ow _is_ it to be managed? I
suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great
question is, what?鈥�

The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at
the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that
looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.
There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as
herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and
behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what
was on the top of it.

She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the
mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar,
that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a
long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything
else.




CHAPTER V.
Advice from a Caterpillar


The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in
silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and
addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.

鈥淲ho are _you?_鈥� said the Caterpillar.

This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,
rather shyly, 鈥淚鈥擨 hardly know, sir, just at present鈥攁t least I know
who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been
changed several times since then.鈥�

鈥淲hat do you mean by that?鈥� said the Caterpillar sternly. 鈥淓xplain
yourself!鈥�

鈥淚 can鈥檛 explain _myself_, I鈥檓 afraid, sir,鈥� said Alice, 鈥渂ecause I鈥檓
not myself, you see.鈥�

鈥淚 don鈥檛 see,鈥� said the Caterpillar.

鈥淚鈥檓 afraid I can鈥檛 put it more clearly,鈥� Alice replied very politely,
鈥渇or I can鈥檛 understand it myself to begin with; and being so many
different sizes in a day is very confusing.鈥�

鈥淚t isn鈥檛,鈥� said the Caterpillar.

鈥淲ell, perhaps you haven鈥檛 found it so yet,鈥� said Alice; 鈥渂ut when you
have to turn into a chrysalis鈥攜ou will some day, you know鈥攁nd then
after that into a butterfly, I should think you鈥檒l feel it a little
queer, won鈥檛 you?鈥�

鈥淣ot a bit,鈥� said the Caterpillar.

鈥淲ell, perhaps your feelings may be different,鈥� said Alice; 鈥渁ll I know
is, it would feel very queer to _me_.鈥�

鈥淵ou!鈥� said the Caterpillar contemptuously. 鈥淲ho are _you?_鈥�

Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.
Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar鈥檚 making such _very_
short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, 鈥淚
think, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.鈥�

鈥淲hy?鈥� said the Caterpillar.

Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any
good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant
state of mind, she turned away.

鈥淐ome back!鈥� the Caterpillar called after her. 鈥淚鈥檝e something
important to say!鈥�

This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.

鈥淜eep your temper,鈥� said the Caterpillar.

鈥淚s that all?鈥� said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she
could.

鈥淣o,鈥� said the Caterpillar.

Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,
and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For
some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded
its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, 鈥淪o you
think you鈥檙e changed, do you?鈥�

鈥淚鈥檓 afraid I am, sir,鈥� said Alice; 鈥淚 can鈥檛 remember things as I
used鈥攁nd I don鈥檛 keep the same size for ten minutes together!鈥�

鈥淐an鈥檛 remember _what_ things?鈥� said the Caterpillar.

鈥淲ell, I鈥檝e tried to say 鈥淗ow doth the little busy bee,鈥� but it all
came different!鈥� Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.

鈥淩epeat, 鈥淿You are old, Father William_,鈥欌€� said the Caterpillar.

Alice folded her hands, and began:鈥�

鈥淵ou are old, Father William,鈥� the young man said,
    鈥淎nd your hair has become very white;
And yet you incessantly stand on your head鈥�
    Do you think, at your age, it is right?鈥�

鈥淚n my youth,鈥� Father William replied to his son,
    鈥淚 feared it might injure the brain;
But, now that I鈥檓 perfectly sure I have none,
    Why, I do it again and again.鈥�

鈥淵ou are old,鈥� said the youth, 鈥渁s I mentioned before,
    And have grown most uncommonly fat;
Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door鈥�
    Pray, what is the reason of that?鈥�

鈥淚n my youth,鈥� said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
    鈥淚 kept all my limbs very supple
By the use of this ointment鈥攐ne shilling the box鈥�
    Allow me to sell you a couple?鈥�

鈥淵ou are old,鈥� said the youth, 鈥渁nd your jaws are too weak
    For anything tougher than suet;
Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak鈥�
    Pray, how did you manage to do it?鈥�

鈥淚n my youth,鈥� said his father, 鈥淚 took to the law,
    And argued each case with my wife;
And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
    Has lasted the rest of my life.鈥�

鈥淵ou are old,鈥� said the youth, 鈥渙ne would hardly suppose
    That your eye was as steady as ever;
Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose鈥�
    What made you so awfully clever?鈥�

鈥淚 have answered three questions, and that is enough,鈥�
    Said his father; 鈥渄on鈥檛 give yourself airs!
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
    Be off, or I鈥檒l kick you down stairs!鈥�


鈥淭hat is not said right,鈥� said the Caterpillar.

鈥淣ot _quite_ right, I鈥檓 afraid,鈥� said Alice, timidly; 鈥渟ome of the
words have got altered.鈥�

鈥淚t is wrong from beginning to end,鈥� said the Caterpillar decidedly,
and there was silence for some minutes.

The Caterpillar was the first to speak.

鈥淲hat size do you want to be?鈥� it asked.

鈥淥h, I鈥檓 not particular as to size,鈥� Alice hastily replied; 鈥渙nly one
doesn鈥檛 like changing so often, you know.鈥�

鈥淚 _don鈥檛_ know,鈥� said the Caterpillar.

Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life
before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.

鈥淎re you content now?鈥� said the Caterpillar.

鈥淲ell, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldn鈥檛
mind,鈥� said Alice: 鈥渢hree inches is such a wretched height to be.鈥�

鈥淚t is a very good height indeed!鈥� said the Caterpillar angrily,
rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).

鈥淏ut I鈥檓 not used to it!鈥� pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she
thought of herself, 鈥淚 wish the creatures wouldn鈥檛 be so easily
offended!鈥�

鈥淵ou鈥檒l get used to it in time,鈥� said the Caterpillar; and it put the
hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.

This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a
minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and
yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the
mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,
鈥淥ne side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you
grow shorter.鈥�

鈥淥ne side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_鈥� thought Alice to
herself.

鈥淥f the mushroom,鈥� said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it
aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.

Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,
trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was
perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at
last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke
off a bit of the edge with each hand.

鈥淎nd now which is which?鈥� she said to herself, and nibbled a little of
the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a
violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!

She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt
that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she
set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed
so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her
mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the
lefthand bit.

*      *      *      *      *      *      *

    *      *      *      *      *      *

*      *      *      *      *      *      *


鈥淐ome, my head鈥檚 free at last!鈥� said Alice in a tone of delight, which
changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders
were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was
an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a
sea of green leaves that lay far below her.

鈥淲hat _can_ all that green stuff be?鈥� said Alice. 鈥淎nd where _have_ my
shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can鈥檛 see you?鈥�
She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,
except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.

As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,
she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that
her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She
had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was
going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but
the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp
hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her
face, and was beating her violently with its wings.

鈥淪erpent!鈥� screamed the Pigeon.

鈥淚鈥檓 _not_ a serpent!鈥� said Alice indignantly. 鈥淟et me alone!鈥�

鈥淪erpent, I say again!鈥� repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued
tone, and added with a kind of sob, 鈥淚鈥檝e tried every way, and nothing
seems to suit them!鈥�

鈥淚 haven鈥檛 the least idea what you鈥檙e talking about,鈥� said Alice.

鈥淚鈥檝e tried the roots of trees, and I鈥檝e tried banks, and I鈥檝e tried
hedges,鈥� the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; 鈥渂ut those
serpents! There鈥檚 no pleasing them!鈥�

Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in
saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.

鈥淎s if it wasn鈥檛 trouble enough hatching the eggs,鈥� said the Pigeon;
鈥渂ut I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I
haven鈥檛 had a wink of sleep these three weeks!鈥�

鈥淚鈥檓 very sorry you鈥檝e been annoyed,鈥� said Alice, who was beginning to
see its meaning.

鈥淎nd just as I鈥檇 taken the highest tree in the wood,鈥� continued the
Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, 鈥渁nd just as I was thinking I
should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down
from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!鈥�

鈥淏ut I鈥檓 _not_ a serpent, I tell you!鈥� said Alice. 鈥淚鈥檓 a鈥擨鈥檓 a鈥斺€�

鈥淲ell! _What_ are you?鈥� said the Pigeon. 鈥淚 can see you鈥檙e trying to
invent something!鈥�

鈥淚鈥擨鈥檓 a little girl,鈥� said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered
the number of changes she had gone through that day.

鈥淎 likely story indeed!鈥� said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest
contempt. 鈥淚鈥檝e seen a good many little girls in my time, but never
_one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! You鈥檙e a serpent; and there鈥檚
no use denying it. I suppose you鈥檒l be telling me next that you never
tasted an egg!鈥�

鈥淚 _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,鈥� said Alice, who was a very truthful
child; 鈥渂ut little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you
know.鈥�

鈥淚 don鈥檛 believe it,鈥� said the Pigeon; 鈥渂ut if they do, why then
they鈥檙e a kind of serpent, that鈥檚 all I can say.鈥�

This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a
minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, 鈥淵ou鈥檙e
looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to
me whether you鈥檙e a little girl or a serpent?鈥�

鈥淚t matters a good deal to _me_,鈥� said Alice hastily; 鈥渂ut I鈥檓 not
looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn鈥檛 want
_yours_: I don鈥檛 like them raw.鈥�

鈥淲ell, be off, then!鈥� said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled
down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well
as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,
and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while
she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,
and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at
the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until
she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.

It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it
felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,
and began talking to herself, as usual. 鈥淐ome, there鈥檚 half my plan
done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I鈥檓 never sure what I鈥檓
going to be, from one minute to another! However, I鈥檝e got back to my
right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden鈥攈ow
_is_ that to be done, I wonder?鈥� As she said this, she came suddenly
upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.
鈥淲hoever lives there,鈥� thought Alice, 鈥渋t鈥檒l never do to come upon them
_this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!鈥� So she
began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go
near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.




CHAPTER VI.
Pig and Pepper


For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what
to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the
wood鈥�(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:
otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a
fish)鈥攁nd rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by
another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a
frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled
all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all
about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.

The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,
nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,
saying, in a solemn tone, 鈥淔or the Duchess. An invitation from the
Queen to play croquet.鈥� The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn
tone, only changing the order of the words a little, 鈥淔rom the Queen.
An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.鈥�

Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.

Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood
for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the
Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the
door, staring stupidly up into the sky.

Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.

鈥淭here鈥檚 no sort of use in knocking,鈥� said the Footman, 鈥渁nd that for
two reasons. First, because I鈥檓 on the same side of the door as you
are; secondly, because they鈥檙e making such a noise inside, no one could
possibly hear you.鈥� And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary
noise going on within鈥攁 constant howling and sneezing, and every now
and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to
pieces.

鈥淧lease, then,鈥� said Alice, 鈥渉ow am I to get in?鈥�

鈥淭here might be some sense in your knocking,鈥� the Footman went on
without attending to her, 鈥渋f we had the door between us. For instance,
if you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you
know.鈥� He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and
this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. 鈥淏ut perhaps he can鈥檛 help it,鈥�
she said to herself; 鈥渉is eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his
head. But at any rate he might answer questions.鈥擧ow am I to get in?鈥�
she repeated, aloud.

鈥淚 shall sit here,鈥� the Footman remarked, 鈥渢ill tomorrow鈥斺€�

At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came
skimming out, straight at the Footman鈥檚 head: it just grazed his nose,
and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.

鈥溾€攐r next day, maybe,鈥� the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly
as if nothing had happened.

鈥淗ow am I to get in?鈥� asked Alice again, in a louder tone.

鈥淿Are_ you to get in at all?鈥� said the Footman. 鈥淭hat鈥檚 the first
question, you know.鈥�

It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. 鈥淚t鈥檚 really
dreadful,鈥� she muttered to herself, 鈥渢he way all the creatures argue.
It鈥檚 enough to drive one crazy!鈥�

The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his
remark, with variations. 鈥淚 shall sit here,鈥� he said, 鈥渙n and off, for
days and days.鈥�

鈥淏ut what am _I_ to do?鈥� said Alice.

鈥淎nything you like,鈥� said the Footman, and began whistling.

鈥淥h, there鈥檚 no use in talking to him,鈥� said Alice desperately: 鈥渉e鈥檚
perfectly idiotic!鈥� And she opened the door and went in.

The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from
one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool
in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire,
stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.

鈥淭here鈥檚 certainly too much pepper in that soup!鈥� Alice said to
herself, as well as she could for sneezing.

There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed
occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling
alternately without a moment鈥檚 pause. The only things in the kitchen
that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting
on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.

鈥淧lease would you tell me,鈥� said Alice, a little timidly, for she was
not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, 鈥渨hy
your cat grins like that?鈥�

鈥淚t鈥檚 a Cheshire cat,鈥� said the Duchess, 鈥渁nd that鈥檚 why. Pig!鈥�

She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite
jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the
baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:鈥�

鈥淚 didn鈥檛 know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn鈥檛
know that cats _could_ grin.鈥�

鈥淭hey all can,鈥� said the Duchess; 鈥渁nd most of 鈥檈m do.鈥�

鈥淚 don鈥檛 know of any that do,鈥� Alice said very politely, feeling quite
pleased to have got into a conversation.

鈥淵ou don鈥檛 know much,鈥� said the Duchess; 鈥渁nd that鈥檚 a fact.鈥�

Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would
be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she
was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the
fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at
the Duchess and the baby鈥攖he fire-irons came first; then followed a
shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of
them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,
that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.

鈥淥h, _please_ mind what you鈥檙e doing!鈥� cried Alice, jumping up and down
in an agony of terror. 鈥淥h, there goes his _precious_ nose!鈥� as an
unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it
off.

鈥淚f everybody minded their own business,鈥� the Duchess said in a hoarse
growl, 鈥渢he world would go round a deal faster than it does.鈥�

鈥淲hich would _not_ be an advantage,鈥� said Alice, who felt very glad to
get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. 鈥淛ust
think of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the
earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis鈥斺€�

鈥淭alking of axes,鈥� said the Duchess, 鈥渃hop off her head!鈥�

Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take
the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to
be listening, so she went on again: 鈥淭wenty-four hours, I _think_; or
is it twelve? I鈥斺€�

鈥淥h, don鈥檛 bother _me_,鈥� said the Duchess; 鈥淚 never could abide
figures!鈥� And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a
sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at
the end of every line:

鈥淪peak roughly to your little boy,
    And beat him when he sneezes:
He only does it to annoy,
    Because he knows it teases.鈥�


CHORUS.
(In which the cook and the baby joined):


鈥淲ow! wow! wow!鈥�


While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing
the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,
that Alice could hardly hear the words:鈥�

鈥淚 speak severely to my boy,
    I beat him when he sneezes;
For he can thoroughly enjoy
    The pepper when he pleases!鈥�


CHORUS.


鈥淲ow! wow! wow!鈥�


鈥淗ere! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!鈥� the Duchess said to Alice,
flinging the baby at her as she spoke. 鈥淚 must go and get ready to play
croquet with the Queen,鈥� and she hurried out of the room. The cook
threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.

Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped
little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,
鈥渏ust like a star-fish,鈥� thought Alice. The poor little thing was
snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling
itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for
the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.

As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to
twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right
ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it
out into the open air. 鈥淚f I don鈥檛 take this child away with me,鈥�
thought Alice, 鈥渢hey鈥檙e sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn鈥檛 it be
murder to leave it behind?鈥� She said the last words out loud, and the
little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).
鈥淒on鈥檛 grunt,鈥� said Alice; 鈥渢hat鈥檚 not at all a proper way of
expressing yourself.鈥�

The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face
to see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had
a _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also
its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did
not like the look of the thing at all. 鈥淏ut perhaps it was only
sobbing,鈥� she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there
were any tears.

No, there were no tears. 鈥淚f you鈥檙e going to turn into a pig, my dear,鈥�
said Alice, seriously, 鈥淚鈥檒l have nothing more to do with you. Mind
now!鈥� The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible
to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.

Alice was just beginning to think to herself, 鈥淣ow, what am I to do
with this creature when I get it home?鈥� when it grunted again, so
violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time
there could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than
a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it
further.

So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it
trot away quietly into the wood. 鈥淚f it had grown up,鈥� she said to
herself, 鈥渋t would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes
rather a handsome pig, I think.鈥� And she began thinking over other
children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying
to herself, 鈥渋f one only knew the right way to change them鈥斺€� when she
was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of
a tree a few yards off.

The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she
thought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she
felt that it ought to be treated with respect.

鈥淐heshire Puss,鈥� she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know
whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little
wider. 鈥淐ome, it鈥檚 pleased so far,鈥� thought Alice, and she went on.
鈥淲ould you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?鈥�

鈥淭hat depends a good deal on where you want to get to,鈥� said the Cat.

鈥淚 don鈥檛 much care where鈥斺€� said Alice.

鈥淭hen it doesn鈥檛 matter which way you go,鈥� said the Cat.

鈥溾€攕o long as I get _somewhere_,鈥� Alice added as an explanation.

鈥淥h, you鈥檙e sure to do that,鈥� said the Cat, 鈥渋f you only walk long
enough.鈥�

Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another
question. 鈥淲hat sort of people live about here?鈥�

鈥淚n _that_ direction,鈥� the Cat said, waving its right paw round, 鈥渓ives
a Hatter: and in _that_ direction,鈥� waving the other paw, 鈥渓ives a
March Hare. Visit either you like: they鈥檙e both mad.鈥�

鈥淏ut I don鈥檛 want to go among mad people,鈥� Alice remarked.

鈥淥h, you can鈥檛 help that,鈥� said the Cat: 鈥渨e鈥檙e all mad here. I鈥檓 mad.
You鈥檙e mad.鈥�

鈥淗ow do you know I鈥檓 mad?鈥� said Alice.

鈥淵ou must be,鈥� said the Cat, 鈥渙r you wouldn鈥檛 have come here.鈥�

Alice didn鈥檛 think that proved it at all; however, she went on 鈥淎nd how
do you know that you鈥檙e mad?鈥�

鈥淭o begin with,鈥� said the Cat, 鈥渁 dog鈥檚 not mad. You grant that?鈥�

鈥淚 suppose so,鈥� said Alice.

鈥淲ell, then,鈥� the Cat went on, 鈥測ou see, a dog growls when it鈥檚 angry,
and wags its tail when it鈥檚 pleased. Now _I_ growl when I鈥檓 pleased,
and wag my tail when I鈥檓 angry. Therefore I鈥檓 mad.鈥�

鈥淿I_ call it purring, not growling,鈥� said Alice.

鈥淐all it what you like,鈥� said the Cat. 鈥淒o you play croquet with the
Queen to-day?鈥�

鈥淚 should like it very much,鈥� said Alice, 鈥渂ut I haven鈥檛 been invited
yet.鈥�

鈥淵ou鈥檒l see me there,鈥� said the Cat, and vanished.

Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer
things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,
it suddenly appeared again.

鈥淏y-the-bye, what became of the baby?鈥� said the Cat. 鈥淚鈥檇 nearly
forgotten to ask.鈥�

鈥淚t turned into a pig,鈥� Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back
in a natural way.

鈥淚 thought it would,鈥� said the Cat, and vanished again.

Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not
appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in
which the March Hare was said to live. 鈥淚鈥檝e seen hatters before,鈥� she
said to herself; 鈥渢he March Hare will be much the most interesting, and
perhaps as this is May it won鈥檛 be raving mad鈥攁t least not so mad as it
was in March.鈥� As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat
again, sitting on a branch of a tree.

鈥淒id you say pig, or fig?鈥� said the Cat.

鈥淚 said pig,鈥� replied Alice; 鈥渁nd I wish you wouldn鈥檛 keep appearing
and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.鈥�

鈥淎ll right,鈥� said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,
beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which
remained some time after the rest of it had gone.

鈥淲ell! I鈥檝e often seen a cat without a grin,鈥� thought Alice; 鈥渂ut a
grin without a cat! It鈥檚 the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!鈥�

She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of
the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the
chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It
was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had
nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself
to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather
timidly, saying to herself 鈥淪uppose it should be raving mad after all!
I almost wish I鈥檇 gone to see the Hatter instead!鈥�




CHAPTER VII.
A Mad Tea-Party


There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the
March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting
between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a
cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. 鈥淰ery
uncomfortable for the Dormouse,鈥� thought Alice; 鈥渙nly, as it鈥檚 asleep,
I suppose it doesn鈥檛 mind.鈥�

The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at
one corner of it: 鈥淣o room! No room!鈥� they cried out when they saw
Alice coming. 鈥淭here鈥檚 _plenty_ of room!鈥� said Alice indignantly, and
she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.

鈥淗ave some wine,鈥� the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.

Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.
鈥淚 don鈥檛 see any wine,鈥� she remarked.

鈥淭here isn鈥檛 any,鈥� said the March Hare.

鈥淭hen it wasn鈥檛 very civil of you to offer it,鈥� said Alice angrily.

鈥淚t wasn鈥檛 very civil of you to sit down without being invited,鈥� said
the March Hare.

鈥淚 didn鈥檛 know it was _your_ table,鈥� said Alice; 鈥渋t鈥檚 laid for a great
many more than three.鈥�

鈥淵our hair wants cutting,鈥� said the Hatter. He had been looking at
Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first
speech.

鈥淵ou should learn not to make personal remarks,鈥� Alice said with some
severity; 鈥渋t鈥檚 very rude.鈥�

The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_
was, 鈥淲hy is a raven like a writing-desk?鈥�

鈥淐ome, we shall have some fun now!鈥� thought Alice. 鈥淚鈥檓 glad they鈥檝e
begun asking riddles.鈥擨 believe I can guess that,鈥� she added aloud.

鈥淒o you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?鈥� said
the March Hare.

鈥淓xactly so,鈥� said Alice.

鈥淭hen you should say what you mean,鈥� the March Hare went on.

鈥淚 do,鈥� Alice hastily replied; 鈥渁t least鈥攁t least I mean what I
say鈥攖hat鈥檚 the same thing, you know.鈥�

鈥淣ot the same thing a bit!鈥� said the Hatter. 鈥淵ou might just as well
say that 鈥業 see what I eat鈥� is the same thing as 鈥業 eat what I see鈥�!鈥�

鈥淵ou might just as well say,鈥� added the March Hare, 鈥渢hat 鈥業 like what
I get鈥� is the same thing as 鈥業 get what I like鈥�!鈥�

鈥淵ou might just as well say,鈥� added the Dormouse, who seemed to be
talking in his sleep, 鈥渢hat 鈥業 breathe when I sleep鈥� is the same thing
as 鈥業 sleep when I breathe鈥�!鈥�

鈥淚t _is_ the same thing with you,鈥� said the Hatter, and here the
conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while
Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and
writing-desks, which wasn鈥檛 much.

The Hatter was the first to break the silence. 鈥淲hat day of the month
is it?鈥� he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his
pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,
and holding it to his ear.

Alice considered a little, and then said 鈥淭he fourth.鈥�

鈥淭wo days wrong!鈥� sighed the Hatter. 鈥淚 told you butter wouldn鈥檛 suit
the works!鈥� he added looking angrily at the March Hare.

鈥淚t was the _best_ butter,鈥� the March Hare meekly replied.

鈥淵es, but some crumbs must have got in as well,鈥� the Hatter grumbled:
鈥測ou shouldn鈥檛 have put it in with the bread-knife.鈥�

The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped
it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of
nothing better to say than his first remark, 鈥淚t was the _best_ butter,
you know.鈥�

Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. 鈥淲hat a
funny watch!鈥� she remarked. 鈥淚t tells the day of the month, and doesn鈥檛
tell what o鈥檆lock it is!鈥�

鈥淲hy should it?鈥� muttered the Hatter. 鈥淒oes _your_ watch tell you what
year it is?鈥�

鈥淥f course not,鈥� Alice replied very readily: 鈥渂ut that鈥檚 because it
stays the same year for such a long time together.鈥�

鈥淲hich is just the case with _mine_,鈥� said the Hatter.

Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter鈥檚 remark seemed to have no
sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. 鈥淚 don鈥檛 quite
understand you,鈥� she said, as politely as she could.

鈥淭he Dormouse is asleep again,鈥� said the Hatter, and he poured a little
hot tea upon its nose.

The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its
eyes, 鈥淥f course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.鈥�

鈥淗ave you guessed the riddle yet?鈥� the Hatter said, turning to Alice
again.

鈥淣o, I give it up,鈥� Alice replied: 鈥渨hat鈥檚 the answer?鈥�

鈥淚 haven鈥檛 the slightest idea,鈥� said the Hatter.

鈥淣or I,鈥� said the March Hare.

Alice sighed wearily. 鈥淚 think you might do something better with the
time,鈥� she said, 鈥渢han waste it in asking riddles that have no
answers.鈥�

鈥淚f you knew Time as well as I do,鈥� said the Hatter, 鈥測ou wouldn鈥檛 talk
about wasting _it_. It鈥檚 _him_.鈥�

鈥淚 don鈥檛 know what you mean,鈥� said Alice.

鈥淥f course you don鈥檛!鈥� the Hatter said, tossing his head
contemptuously. 鈥淚 dare say you never even spoke to Time!鈥�

鈥淧erhaps not,鈥� Alice cautiously replied: 鈥渂ut I know I have to beat
time when I learn music.鈥�

鈥淎h! that accounts for it,鈥� said the Hatter. 鈥淗e won鈥檛 stand beating.
Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he鈥檇 do almost anything
you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o鈥檆lock in
the morning, just time to begin lessons: you鈥檇 only have to whisper a
hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,
time for dinner!鈥�

(鈥淚 only wish it was,鈥� the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)

鈥淭hat would be grand, certainly,鈥� said Alice thoughtfully: 鈥渂ut then鈥擨
shouldn鈥檛 be hungry for it, you know.鈥�

鈥淣ot at first, perhaps,鈥� said the Hatter: 鈥渂ut you could keep it to
half-past one as long as you liked.鈥�

鈥淚s that the way _you_ manage?鈥� Alice asked.

The Hatter shook his head mournfully. 鈥淣ot I!鈥� he replied. 鈥淲e
quarrelled last March鈥攋ust before _he_ went mad, you know鈥斺€� (pointing
with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) 鈥溾€攊t was at the great concert
given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing

鈥楾winkle, twinkle, little bat!
How I wonder what you鈥檙e at!鈥�


You know the song, perhaps?鈥�

鈥淚鈥檝e heard something like it,鈥� said Alice.

鈥淚t goes on, you know,鈥� the Hatter continued, 鈥渋n this way:鈥�

鈥楿p above the world you fly,
Like a tea-tray in the sky.
                    Twinkle, twinkle鈥斺€欌€�


Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep
鈥淿Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_鈥斺€� and went on so long that they
had to pinch it to make it stop.

鈥淲ell, I鈥檇 hardly finished the first verse,鈥� said the Hatter, 鈥渨hen the
Queen jumped up and bawled out, 鈥楬e鈥檚 murdering the time! Off with his
head!鈥欌€�

鈥淗ow dreadfully savage!鈥� exclaimed Alice.

鈥淎nd ever since that,鈥� the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, 鈥渉e won鈥檛
do a thing I ask! It鈥檚 always six o鈥檆lock now.鈥�

A bright idea came into Alice鈥檚 head. 鈥淚s that the reason so many
tea-things are put out here?鈥� she asked.

鈥淵es, that鈥檚 it,鈥� said the Hatter with a sigh: 鈥渋t鈥檚 always tea-time,
and we鈥檝e no time to wash the things between whiles.鈥�

鈥淭hen you keep moving round, I suppose?鈥� said Alice.

鈥淓xactly so,鈥� said the Hatter: 鈥渁s the things get used up.鈥�

鈥淏ut what happens when you come to the beginning again?鈥� Alice ventured
to ask.

鈥淪uppose we change the subject,鈥� the March Hare interrupted, yawning.
鈥淚鈥檓 getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.鈥�

鈥淚鈥檓 afraid I don鈥檛 know one,鈥� said Alice, rather alarmed at the
proposal.

鈥淭hen the Dormouse shall!鈥� they both cried. 鈥淲ake up, Dormouse!鈥� And
they pinched it on both sides at once.

The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. 鈥淚 wasn鈥檛 asleep,鈥� he said in a
hoarse, feeble voice: 鈥淚 heard every word you fellows were saying.鈥�

鈥淭ell us a story!鈥� said the March Hare.

鈥淵es, please do!鈥� pleaded Alice.

鈥淎nd be quick about it,鈥� added the Hatter, 鈥渙r you鈥檒l be asleep again
before it鈥檚 done.鈥�

鈥淥nce upon a time there were three little sisters,鈥� the Dormouse began
in a great hurry; 鈥渁nd their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and
they lived at the bottom of a well鈥斺€�

鈥淲hat did they live on?鈥� said Alice, who always took a great interest
in questions of eating and drinking.

鈥淭hey lived on treacle,鈥� said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or
two.

鈥淭hey couldn鈥檛 have done that, you know,鈥� Alice gently remarked;
鈥渢hey鈥檇 have been ill.鈥�

鈥淪o they were,鈥� said the Dormouse; 鈥淿very_ ill.鈥�

Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of
living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: 鈥淏ut
why did they live at the bottom of a well?鈥�

鈥淭ake some more tea,鈥� the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.

鈥淚鈥檝e had nothing yet,鈥� Alice replied in an offended tone, 鈥渟o I can鈥檛
take more.鈥�

鈥淵ou mean you can鈥檛 take _less_,鈥� said the Hatter: 鈥渋t鈥檚 very easy to
take _more_ than nothing.鈥�

鈥淣obody asked _your_ opinion,鈥� said Alice.

鈥淲ho鈥檚 making personal remarks now?鈥� the Hatter asked triumphantly.

Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to
some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and
repeated her question. 鈥淲hy did they live at the bottom of a well?鈥�

The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then
said, 鈥淚t was a treacle-well.鈥�

鈥淭here鈥檚 no such thing!鈥� Alice was beginning very angrily, but the
Hatter and the March Hare went 鈥淪h! sh!鈥� and the Dormouse sulkily
remarked, 鈥淚f you can鈥檛 be civil, you鈥檇 better finish the story for
yourself.鈥�

鈥淣o, please go on!鈥� Alice said very humbly; 鈥淚 won鈥檛 interrupt again. I
dare say there may be _one_.鈥�

鈥淥ne, indeed!鈥� said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to
go on. 鈥淎nd so these three little sisters鈥攖hey were learning to draw,
you know鈥斺€�

鈥淲hat did they draw?鈥� said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.

鈥淭reacle,鈥� said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.

鈥淚 want a clean cup,鈥� interrupted the Hatter: 鈥渓et鈥檚 all move one place
on.鈥�

He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare
moved into the Dormouse鈥檚 place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the
place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any
advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than
before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.

Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very
cautiously: 鈥淏ut I don鈥檛 understand. Where did they draw the treacle
from?鈥�

鈥淵ou can draw water out of a water-well,鈥� said the Hatter; 鈥渟o I should
think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well鈥攅h, stupid?鈥�

鈥淏ut they were _in_ the well,鈥� Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing
to notice this last remark.

鈥淥f course they were,鈥� said the Dormouse; 鈥溾€攚ell in.鈥�

This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for
some time without interrupting it.

鈥淭hey were learning to draw,鈥� the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing
its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; 鈥渁nd they drew all manner of
things鈥攅verything that begins with an M鈥斺€�

鈥淲hy with an M?鈥� said Alice.

鈥淲hy not?鈥� said the March Hare.

Alice was silent.

The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a
doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a
little shriek, and went on: 鈥溾€攖hat begins with an M, such as
mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness鈥攜ou know you say
things are 鈥渕uch of a muchness鈥濃€攄id you ever see such a thing as a
drawing of a muchness?鈥�

鈥淩eally, now you ask me,鈥� said Alice, very much confused, 鈥淚 don鈥檛
think鈥斺€�

鈥淭hen you shouldn鈥檛 talk,鈥� said the Hatter.

This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in
great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and
neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she
looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:
the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into
the teapot.

鈥淎t any rate I鈥檒l never go _there_ again!鈥� said Alice as she picked her
way through the wood. 鈥淚t鈥檚 the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in
all my life!鈥�

Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door
leading right into it. 鈥淭hat鈥檚 very curious!鈥� she thought. 鈥淏ut
everything鈥檚 curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.鈥� And
in she went.

Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little
glass table. 鈥淣ow, I鈥檒l manage better this time,鈥� she said to herself,
and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that
led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom
(she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot
high: then she walked down the little passage: and _then_鈥攕he found
herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds
and the cool fountains.




CHAPTER VIII.
The Queen鈥檚 Croquet-Ground


A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses
growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily
painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she
went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard
one of them say, 鈥淟ook out now, Five! Don鈥檛 go splashing paint over me
like that!鈥�

鈥淚 couldn鈥檛 help it,鈥� said Five, in a sulky tone; 鈥淪even jogged my
elbow.鈥�

On which Seven looked up and said, 鈥淭hat鈥檚 right, Five! Always lay the
blame on others!鈥�

鈥淿You鈥檇_ better not talk!鈥� said Five. 鈥淚 heard the Queen say only
yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!鈥�

鈥淲hat for?鈥� said the one who had spoken first.

鈥淭hat鈥檚 none of _your_ business, Two!鈥� said Seven.

鈥淵es, it _is_ his business!鈥� said Five, 鈥渁nd I鈥檒l tell him鈥攊t was for
bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.鈥�

Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun 鈥淲ell, of all the unjust
things鈥斺€� when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching
them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also,
and all of them bowed low.

鈥淲ould you tell me,鈥� said Alice, a little timidly, 鈥渨hy you are
painting those roses?鈥�

Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low
voice, 鈥淲hy the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a
_red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen
was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So
you see, Miss, we鈥檙e doing our best, afore she comes, to鈥斺€� At this
moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called
out 鈥淭he Queen! The Queen!鈥� and the three gardeners instantly threw
themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,
and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.

First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the
three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the
corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with
diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came
the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came
jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all
ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,
and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a
hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went
by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying
the King鈥檚 crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this
grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.

Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face
like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard
of such a rule at processions; 鈥渁nd besides, what would be the use of a
procession,鈥� thought she, 鈥渋f people had all to lie down upon their
faces, so that they couldn鈥檛 see it?鈥� So she stood still where she was,
and waited.

When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked
at her, and the Queen said severely 鈥淲ho is this?鈥� She said it to the
Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.

鈥淚diot!鈥� said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to
Alice, she went on, 鈥淲hat鈥檚 your name, child?鈥�

鈥淢y name is Alice, so please your Majesty,鈥� said Alice very politely;
but she added, to herself, 鈥淲hy, they鈥檙e only a pack of cards, after
all. I needn鈥檛 be afraid of them!鈥�

鈥淎nd who are _these?_鈥� said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners
who were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on
their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of
the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers,
or courtiers, or three of her own children.

鈥淗ow should _I_ know?鈥� said Alice, surprised at her own courage. 鈥淚t鈥檚
no business of _mine_.鈥�

The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a
moment like a wild beast, screamed 鈥淥ff with her head! Off鈥斺€�

鈥淣onsense!鈥� said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was
silent.

The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said 鈥淐onsider, my
dear: she is only a child!鈥�

The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave 鈥淭urn
them over!鈥�

The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.

鈥淕et up!鈥� said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three
gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,
the royal children, and everybody else.

鈥淟eave off that!鈥� screamed the Queen. 鈥淵ou make me giddy.鈥� And then,
turning to the rose-tree, she went on, 鈥淲hat _have_ you been doing
here?鈥�

鈥淢ay it please your Majesty,鈥� said Two, in a very humble tone, going
down on one knee as he spoke, 鈥渨e were trying鈥斺€�

鈥淿I_ see!鈥� said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.
鈥淥ff with their heads!鈥� and the procession moved on, three of the
soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran
to Alice for protection.

鈥淵ou shan鈥檛 be beheaded!鈥� said Alice, and she put them into a large
flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a
minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the
others.

鈥淎re their heads off?鈥� shouted the Queen.

鈥淭heir heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!鈥� the soldiers shouted
in reply.

鈥淭hat鈥檚 right!鈥� shouted the Queen. 鈥淐an you play croquet?鈥�

The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was
evidently meant for her.

鈥淵es!鈥� shouted Alice.

鈥淐ome on, then!鈥� roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,
wondering very much what would happen next.

鈥淚t鈥檚鈥攊t鈥檚 a very fine day!鈥� said a timid voice at her side. She was
walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.

鈥淰ery,鈥� said Alice: 鈥溾€攚here鈥檚 the Duchess?鈥�

鈥淗ush! Hush!鈥� said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked
anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon
tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered 鈥淪he鈥檚 under
sentence of execution.鈥�

鈥淲hat for?鈥� said Alice.

鈥淒id you say 鈥榃hat a pity!鈥�?鈥� the Rabbit asked.

鈥淣o, I didn鈥檛,鈥� said Alice: 鈥淚 don鈥檛 think it鈥檚 at all a pity. I said
鈥榃hat for?鈥欌€�

鈥淪he boxed the Queen鈥檚 ears鈥斺€� the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little
scream of laughter. 鈥淥h, hush!鈥� the Rabbit whispered in a frightened
tone. 鈥淭he Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the
Queen said鈥斺€�

鈥淕et to your places!鈥� shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and
people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each
other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game
began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground
in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live
hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double
themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.

The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:
she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,
under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she
had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the
hedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look
up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help
bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was
going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog
had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all
this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she
wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were
always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice
soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.

The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling
all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time
the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and
shouting 鈥淥ff with his head!鈥� or 鈥淥ff with her head!鈥� about once in a
minute.

Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any
dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,
鈥渁nd then,鈥� thought she, 鈥渨hat would become of me? They鈥檙e dreadfully
fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there鈥檚 any
one left alive!鈥�

She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she
could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious
appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after
watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said
to herself 鈥淚t鈥檚 the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk
to.鈥�

鈥淗ow are you getting on?鈥� said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth
enough for it to speak with.

Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. 鈥淚t鈥檚 no use
speaking to it,鈥� she thought, 鈥渢ill its ears have come, or at least one
of them.鈥� In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put
down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad
she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there
was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.

鈥淚 don鈥檛 think they play at all fairly,鈥� Alice began, in rather a
complaining tone, 鈥渁nd they all quarrel so dreadfully one can鈥檛 hear
oneself speak鈥攁nd they don鈥檛 seem to have any rules in particular; at
least, if there are, nobody attends to them鈥攁nd you鈥檝e no idea how
confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there鈥檚 the
arch I鈥檝e got to go through next walking about at the other end of the
ground鈥攁nd I should have croqueted the Queen鈥檚 hedgehog just now, only
it ran away when it saw mine coming!鈥�

鈥淗ow do you like the Queen?鈥� said the Cat in a low voice.

鈥淣ot at all,鈥� said Alice: 鈥渟he鈥檚 so extremely鈥斺€� Just then she noticed
that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,
鈥溾€攍ikely to win, that it鈥檚 hardly worth while finishing the game.鈥�

The Queen smiled and passed on.

鈥淲ho _are_ you talking to?鈥� said the King, going up to Alice, and
looking at the Cat鈥檚 head with great curiosity.

鈥淚t鈥檚 a friend of mine鈥攁 Cheshire Cat,鈥� said Alice: 鈥渁llow me to
introduce it.鈥�

鈥淚 don鈥檛 like the look of it at all,鈥� said the King: 鈥渉owever, it may
kiss my hand if it likes.鈥�

鈥淚鈥檇 rather not,鈥� the Cat remarked.

鈥淒on鈥檛 be impertinent,鈥� said the King, 鈥渁nd don鈥檛 look at me like
that!鈥� He got behind Alice as he spoke.

鈥淎 cat may look at a king,鈥� said Alice. 鈥淚鈥檝e read that in some book,
but I don鈥檛 remember where.鈥�

鈥淲ell, it must be removed,鈥� said the King very decidedly, and he called
the Queen, who was passing at the moment, 鈥淢y dear! I wish you would
have this cat removed!鈥�

The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or
small. 鈥淥ff with his head!鈥� she said, without even looking round.

鈥淚鈥檒l fetch the executioner myself,鈥� said the King eagerly, and he
hurried off.

Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going
on, as she heard the Queen鈥檚 voice in the distance, screaming with
passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be
executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look
of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew
whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.

The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed
to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the
other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to
the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a
helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.

By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight
was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: 鈥渂ut it doesn鈥檛
matter much,鈥� thought Alice, 鈥渁s all the arches are gone from this side
of the ground.鈥� So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not
escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her
friend.

When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite
a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between
the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,
while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.

The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle
the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they
all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly
what they said.

The executioner鈥檚 argument was, that you couldn鈥檛 cut off a head unless
there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a
thing before, and he wasn鈥檛 going to begin at _his_ time of life.

The King鈥檚 argument was, that anything that had a head could be
beheaded, and that you weren鈥檛 to talk nonsense.

The Queen鈥檚 argument was, that if something wasn鈥檛 done about it in
less than no time she鈥檇 have everybody executed, all round. (It was
this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and
anxious.)

Alice could think of nothing else to say but 鈥淚t belongs to the
Duchess: you鈥檇 better ask _her_ about it.鈥�

鈥淪he鈥檚 in prison,鈥� the Queen said to the executioner: 鈥渇etch her here.鈥�
And the executioner went off like an arrow.

The Cat鈥檚 head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the
time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so
the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it,
while the rest of the party went back to the game.




CHAPTER IX.
The Mock Turtle鈥檚 Story


鈥淵ou can鈥檛 think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!鈥�
said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice鈥檚,
and they walked off together.

Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought
to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so
savage when they met in the kitchen.

鈥淲hen _I鈥檓_ a Duchess,鈥� she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful
tone though), 鈥淚 won鈥檛 have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_. Soup
does very well without鈥擬aybe it鈥檚 always pepper that makes people
hot-tempered,鈥� she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new
kind of rule, 鈥渁nd vinegar that makes them sour鈥攁nd camomile that makes
them bitter鈥攁nd鈥攁nd barley-sugar and such things that make children
sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn鈥檛 be
so stingy about it, you know鈥斺€�

She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little
startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. 鈥淵ou鈥檙e thinking
about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can鈥檛
tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in
a bit.鈥�

鈥淧erhaps it hasn鈥檛 one,鈥� Alice ventured to remark.

鈥淭ut, tut, child!鈥� said the Duchess. 鈥淓verything鈥檚 got a moral, if only
you can find it.鈥� And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice鈥檚 side as
she spoke.

Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the
Duchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the
right height to rest her chin upon Alice鈥檚 shoulder, and it was an
uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she
bore it as well as she could.

鈥淭he game鈥檚 going on rather better now,鈥� she said, by way of keeping up
the conversation a little.

鈥溾€橳is so,鈥� said the Duchess: 鈥渁nd the moral of that is鈥斺€極h, 鈥檛is love,
鈥檛is love, that makes the world go round!鈥欌€�

鈥淪omebody said,鈥� Alice whispered, 鈥渢hat it鈥檚 done by everybody minding
their own business!鈥�

鈥淎h, well! It means much the same thing,鈥� said the Duchess, digging her
sharp little chin into Alice鈥檚 shoulder as she added, 鈥渁nd the moral of
_that_ is鈥斺€楾ake care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of
themselves.鈥欌€�

鈥淗ow fond she is of finding morals in things!鈥� Alice thought to
herself.

鈥淚 dare say you鈥檙e wondering why I don鈥檛 put my arm round your waist,鈥�
the Duchess said after a pause: 鈥渢he reason is, that I鈥檓 doubtful about
the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?鈥�

鈥淗e might bite,鈥� Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious
to have the experiment tried.

鈥淰ery true,鈥� said the Duchess: 鈥渇lamingoes and mustard both bite. And
the moral of that is鈥斺€楤irds of a feather flock together.鈥欌€�

鈥淥nly mustard isn鈥檛 a bird,鈥� Alice remarked.

鈥淩ight, as usual,鈥� said the Duchess: 鈥渨hat a clear way you have of
putting things!鈥�

鈥淚t鈥檚 a mineral, I _think_,鈥� said Alice.

鈥淥f course it is,鈥� said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to
everything that Alice said; 鈥渢here鈥檚 a large mustard-mine near here.
And the moral of that is鈥斺€楾he more there is of mine, the less there is
of yours.鈥欌€�

鈥淥h, I know!鈥� exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last
remark, 鈥渋t鈥檚 a vegetable. It doesn鈥檛 look like one, but it is.鈥�

鈥淚 quite agree with you,鈥� said the Duchess; 鈥渁nd the moral of that
is鈥斺€楤e what you would seem to be鈥欌€攐r if you鈥檇 like it put more
simply鈥斺€楴ever imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might
appear to others that what you were or might have been was not
otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be
otherwise.鈥欌€�

鈥淚 think I should understand that better,鈥� Alice said very politely,
鈥渋f I had it written down: but I can鈥檛 quite follow it as you say it.鈥�

鈥淭hat鈥檚 nothing to what I could say if I chose,鈥� the Duchess replied,
in a pleased tone.

鈥淧ray don鈥檛 trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,鈥� said
Alice.

鈥淥h, don鈥檛 talk about trouble!鈥� said the Duchess. 鈥淚 make you a present
of everything I鈥檝e said as yet.鈥�

鈥淎 cheap sort of present!鈥� thought Alice. 鈥淚鈥檓 glad they don鈥檛 give
birthday presents like that!鈥� But she did not venture to say it out
loud.

鈥淭hinking again?鈥� the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp
little chin.

鈥淚鈥檝e a right to think,鈥� said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to
feel a little worried.

鈥淛ust about as much right,鈥� said the Duchess, 鈥渁s pigs have to fly; and
the m鈥斺€�

But here, to Alice鈥檚 great surprise, the Duchess鈥檚 voice died away,
even in the middle of her favourite word 鈥榤oral,鈥� and the arm that was
linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the
Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a
thunderstorm.

鈥淎 fine day, your Majesty!鈥� the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.

鈥淣ow, I give you fair warning,鈥� shouted the Queen, stamping on the
ground as she spoke; 鈥渆ither you or your head must be off, and that in
about half no time! Take your choice!鈥�

The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.

鈥淟et鈥檚 go on with the game,鈥� the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too
much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the
croquet-ground.

The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen鈥檚 absence, and were
resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried
back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment鈥檚 delay
would cost them their lives.

All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling
with the other players, and shouting 鈥淥ff with his head!鈥� or 鈥淥ff with
her head!鈥� Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the
soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so
that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and
all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody
and under sentence of execution.

Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, 鈥淗ave
you seen the Mock Turtle yet?鈥�

鈥淣o,鈥� said Alice. 鈥淚 don鈥檛 even know what a Mock Turtle is.鈥�

鈥淚t鈥檚 the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,鈥� said the Queen.

鈥淚 never saw one, or heard of one,鈥� said Alice.

鈥淐ome on, then,鈥� said the Queen, 鈥渁nd he shall tell you his history,鈥�

As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,
to the company generally, 鈥淵ou are all pardoned.鈥� 鈥淐ome, _that鈥檚_ a
good thing!鈥� she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the
number of executions the Queen had ordered.

They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If
you don鈥檛 know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) 鈥淯p, lazy
thing!鈥� said the Queen, 鈥渁nd take this young lady to see the Mock
Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some
executions I have ordered;鈥� and she walked off, leaving Alice alone
with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature,
but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it
as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.

The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till
she was out of sight: then it chuckled. 鈥淲hat fun!鈥� said the Gryphon,
half to itself, half to Alice.

鈥淲hat _is_ the fun?鈥� said Alice.

鈥淲hy, _she_,鈥� said the Gryphon. 鈥淚t鈥檚 all her fancy, that: they never
executes nobody, you know. Come on!鈥�

鈥淓verybody says 鈥榗ome on!鈥� here,鈥� thought Alice, as she went slowly
after it: 鈥淚 never was so ordered about in all my life, never!鈥�

They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,
sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came
nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She
pitied him deeply. 鈥淲hat is his sorrow?鈥� she asked the Gryphon, and the
Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, 鈥淚t鈥檚 all
his fancy, that: he hasn鈥檛 got no sorrow, you know. Come on!鈥�

So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes
full of tears, but said nothing.

鈥淭his here young lady,鈥� said the Gryphon, 鈥渟he wants for to know your
history, she do.鈥�

鈥淚鈥檒l tell it her,鈥� said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: 鈥渟it
down, both of you, and don鈥檛 speak a word till I鈥檝e finished.鈥�

So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to
herself, 鈥淚 don鈥檛 see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesn鈥檛 begin.鈥�
But she waited patiently.

鈥淥nce,鈥� said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, 鈥淚 was a real
Turtle.鈥�

These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an
occasional exclamation of 鈥淗jckrrh!鈥� from the Gryphon, and the constant
heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and
saying, 鈥淭hank you, sir, for your interesting story,鈥� but she could not
help thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said
nothing.

鈥淲hen we were little,鈥� the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,
though still sobbing a little now and then, 鈥渨e went to school in the
sea. The master was an old Turtle鈥攚e used to call him Tortoise鈥斺€�

鈥淲hy did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn鈥檛 one?鈥� Alice asked.

鈥淲e called him Tortoise because he taught us,鈥� said the Mock Turtle
angrily: 鈥渞eally you are very dull!鈥�

鈥淵ou ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple
question,鈥� added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked
at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the
Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, 鈥淒rive on, old fellow! Don鈥檛 be all
day about it!鈥� and he went on in these words:

鈥淵es, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn鈥檛 believe it鈥斺€�

鈥淚 never said I didn鈥檛!鈥� interrupted Alice.

鈥淵ou did,鈥� said the Mock Turtle.

鈥淗old your tongue!鈥� added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.
The Mock Turtle went on.

鈥淲e had the best of educations鈥攊n fact, we went to school every day鈥斺€�

鈥淿I鈥檝e_ been to a day-school, too,鈥� said Alice; 鈥測ou needn鈥檛 be so
proud as all that.鈥�

鈥淲ith extras?鈥� asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.

鈥淵es,鈥� said Alice, 鈥渨e learned French and music.鈥�

鈥淎nd washing?鈥� said the Mock Turtle.

鈥淐ertainly not!鈥� said Alice indignantly.

鈥淎h! then yours wasn鈥檛 a really good school,鈥� said the Mock Turtle in a
tone of great relief. 鈥淣ow at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill,
鈥楩rench, music, _and washing_鈥攅xtra.鈥欌€�

鈥淵ou couldn鈥檛 have wanted it much,鈥� said Alice; 鈥渓iving at the bottom
of the sea.鈥�

鈥淚 couldn鈥檛 afford to learn it.鈥� said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. 鈥淚
only took the regular course.鈥�

鈥淲hat was that?鈥� inquired Alice.

鈥淩eeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,鈥� the Mock Turtle
replied; 鈥渁nd then the different branches of Arithmetic鈥擜mbition,
Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.鈥�

鈥淚 never heard of 鈥楿glification,鈥欌€� Alice ventured to say. 鈥淲hat is it?鈥�

The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. 鈥淲hat! Never heard of
uglifying!鈥� it exclaimed. 鈥淵ou know what to beautify is, I suppose?鈥�

鈥淵es,鈥� said Alice doubtfully: 鈥渋t means鈥攖o鈥攎ake鈥攁nything鈥攑rettier.鈥�

鈥淲ell, then,鈥� the Gryphon went on, 鈥渋f you don鈥檛 know what to uglify
is, you _are_ a simpleton.鈥�

Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so
she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said 鈥淲hat else had you to learn?鈥�

鈥淲ell, there was Mystery,鈥� the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the
subjects on his flappers, 鈥溾€擬ystery, ancient and modern, with
Seaography: then Drawling鈥攖he Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,
that used to come once a week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and
Fainting in Coils.鈥�

鈥淲hat was _that_ like?鈥� said Alice.

鈥淲ell, I can鈥檛 show it you myself,鈥� the Mock Turtle said: 鈥淚鈥檓 too
stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.鈥�

鈥淗adn鈥檛 time,鈥� said the Gryphon: 鈥淚 went to the Classics master,
though. He was an old crab, _he_ was.鈥�

鈥淚 never went to him,鈥� the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: 鈥渉e taught
Laughing and Grief, they used to say.鈥�

鈥淪o he did, so he did,鈥� said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both
creatures hid their faces in their paws.

鈥淎nd how many hours a day did you do lessons?鈥� said Alice, in a hurry
to change the subject.

鈥淭en hours the first day,鈥� said the Mock Turtle: 鈥渘ine the next, and so
on.鈥�

鈥淲hat a curious plan!鈥� exclaimed Alice.

鈥淭hat鈥檚 the reason they鈥檙e called lessons,鈥� the Gryphon remarked:
鈥渂ecause they lessen from day to day.鈥�

This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little
before she made her next remark. 鈥淭hen the eleventh day must have been
a holiday?鈥�

鈥淥f course it was,鈥� said the Mock Turtle.

鈥淎nd how did you manage on the twelfth?鈥� Alice went on eagerly.

鈥淭hat鈥檚 enough about lessons,鈥� the Gryphon interrupted in a very
decided tone: 鈥渢ell her something about the games now.鈥�




CHAPTER X.
The Lobster Quadrille


The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across
his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or
two sobs choked his voice. 鈥淪ame as if he had a bone in his throat,鈥�
said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in
the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears
running down his cheeks, he went on again:鈥�

鈥淵ou may not have lived much under the sea鈥斺€� (鈥淚 haven鈥檛,鈥� said
Alice)鈥斺€渁nd perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster鈥斺€�
(Alice began to say 鈥淚 once tasted鈥斺€� but checked herself hastily, and
said 鈥淣o, never鈥�) 鈥溾€攕o you can have no idea what a delightful thing a
Lobster Quadrille is!鈥�

鈥淣o, indeed,鈥� said Alice. 鈥淲hat sort of a dance is it?鈥�

鈥淲hy,鈥� said the Gryphon, 鈥測ou first form into a line along the
sea-shore鈥斺€�

鈥淭wo lines!鈥� cried the Mock Turtle. 鈥淪eals, turtles, salmon, and so on;
then, when you鈥檝e cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way鈥斺€�

鈥淿That_ generally takes some time,鈥� interrupted the Gryphon.

鈥溾€攜ou advance twice鈥斺€�

鈥淓ach with a lobster as a partner!鈥� cried the Gryphon.

鈥淥f course,鈥� the Mock Turtle said: 鈥渁dvance twice, set to partners鈥斺€�

鈥溾€攃hange lobsters, and retire in same order,鈥� continued the Gryphon.

鈥淭hen, you know,鈥� the Mock Turtle went on, 鈥測ou throw the鈥斺€�

鈥淭he lobsters!鈥� shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.

鈥溾€攁s far out to sea as you can鈥斺€�

鈥淪wim after them!鈥� screamed the Gryphon.

鈥淭urn a somersault in the sea!鈥� cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly
about.

鈥淐hange lobsters again!鈥� yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.

鈥淏ack to land again, and that鈥檚 all the first figure,鈥� said the Mock
Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had
been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very
sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.

鈥淚t must be a very pretty dance,鈥� said Alice timidly.

鈥淲ould you like to see a little of it?鈥� said the Mock Turtle.

鈥淰ery much indeed,鈥� said Alice.

鈥淐ome, let鈥檚 try the first figure!鈥� said the Mock Turtle to the
Gryphon. 鈥淲e can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?鈥�

鈥淥h, _you_ sing,鈥� said the Gryphon. 鈥淚鈥檝e forgotten the words.鈥�

So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and
then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their
forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly
and sadly:鈥�

鈥淲ill you walk a little faster?鈥� said a whiting to a snail.
鈥淭here鈥檚 a porpoise close behind us, and he鈥檚 treading on my tail.
See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
They are waiting on the shingle鈥攚ill you come and join the dance?
Will you, won鈥檛 you, will you, won鈥檛 you, will you join the dance?
Will you, won鈥檛 you, will you, won鈥檛 you, won鈥檛 you join the dance?

鈥淵ou can really have no notion how delightful it will be
When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!鈥�
But the snail replied 鈥淭oo far, too far!鈥� and gave a look askance鈥�
Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.
Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.
Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.

鈥淲hat matters it how far we go?鈥� his scaly friend replied.
鈥淭here is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
The further off from England the nearer is to France鈥�
Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.
Will you, won鈥檛 you, will you, won鈥檛 you, will you join the dance?
Will you, won鈥檛 you, will you, won鈥檛 you, won鈥檛 you join the dance?鈥�


鈥淭hank you, it鈥檚 a very interesting dance to watch,鈥� said Alice,
feeling very glad that it was over at last: 鈥渁nd I do so like that
curious song about the whiting!鈥�

鈥淥h, as to the whiting,鈥� said the Mock Turtle, 鈥渢hey鈥攜ou鈥檝e seen them,
of course?鈥�

鈥淵es,鈥� said Alice, 鈥淚鈥檝e often seen them at dinn鈥斺€� she checked herself
hastily.

鈥淚 don鈥檛 know where Dinn may be,鈥� said the Mock Turtle, 鈥渂ut if you鈥檝e
seen them so often, of course you know what they鈥檙e like.鈥�

鈥淚 believe so,鈥� Alice replied thoughtfully. 鈥淭hey have their tails in
their mouths鈥攁nd they鈥檙e all over crumbs.鈥�

鈥淵ou鈥檙e wrong about the crumbs,鈥� said the Mock Turtle: 鈥渃rumbs would
all wash off in the sea. But they _have_ their tails in their mouths;
and the reason is鈥斺€� here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his
eyes.鈥斺€淭ell her about the reason and all that,鈥� he said to the Gryphon.

鈥淭he reason is,鈥� said the Gryphon, 鈥渢hat they _would_ go with the
lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to
fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they
couldn鈥檛 get them out again. That鈥檚 all.鈥�

鈥淭hank you,鈥� said Alice, 鈥渋t鈥檚 very interesting. I never knew so much
about a whiting before.鈥�

鈥淚 can tell you more than that, if you like,鈥� said the Gryphon. 鈥淒o you
know why it鈥檚 called a whiting?鈥�

鈥淚 never thought about it,鈥� said Alice. 鈥淲hy?鈥�

鈥淿It does the boots and shoes_,鈥� the Gryphon replied very solemnly.

Alice was thoroughly puzzled. 鈥淒oes the boots and shoes!鈥� she repeated
in a wondering tone.

鈥淲hy, what are _your_ shoes done with?鈥� said the Gryphon. 鈥淚 mean, what
makes them so shiny?鈥�

Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her
answer. 鈥淭hey鈥檙e done with blacking, I believe.鈥�

鈥淏oots and shoes under the sea,鈥� the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,
鈥渁re done with a whiting. Now you know.鈥�

鈥淎nd what are they made of?鈥� Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.

鈥淪oles and eels, of course,鈥� the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:
鈥渁ny shrimp could have told you that.鈥�

鈥淚f I鈥檇 been the whiting,鈥� said Alice, whose thoughts were still
running on the song, 鈥淚鈥檇 have said to the porpoise, 鈥楰eep back,
please: we don鈥檛 want _you_ with us!鈥欌€�

鈥淭hey were obliged to have him with them,鈥� the Mock Turtle said: 鈥渘o
wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.鈥�

鈥淲ouldn鈥檛 it really?鈥� said Alice in a tone of great surprise.

鈥淥f course not,鈥� said the Mock Turtle: 鈥渨hy, if a fish came to _me_,
and told me he was going a journey, I should say 鈥榃ith what porpoise?鈥欌€�

鈥淒on鈥檛 you mean 鈥榩urpose鈥�?鈥� said Alice.

鈥淚 mean what I say,鈥� the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And
the Gryphon added 鈥淐ome, let鈥檚 hear some of _your_ adventures.鈥�

鈥淚 could tell you my adventures鈥攂eginning from this morning,鈥� said
Alice a little timidly: 鈥渂ut it鈥檚 no use going back to yesterday,
because I was a different person then.鈥�

鈥淓xplain all that,鈥� said the Mock Turtle.

鈥淣o, no! The adventures first,鈥� said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:
鈥渆xplanations take such a dreadful time.鈥�

So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first
saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,
the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened
their eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she
went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part
about her repeating 鈥淿You are old, Father William_,鈥� to the
Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock
Turtle drew a long breath, and said 鈥淭hat鈥檚 very curious.鈥�

鈥淚t鈥檚 all about as curious as it can be,鈥� said the Gryphon.

鈥淚t all came different!鈥� the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. 鈥淚
should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to
begin.鈥� He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of
authority over Alice.

鈥淪tand up and repeat 鈥樷€檁Tis the voice of the sluggard_,鈥欌€� said the
Gryphon.

鈥淗ow the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!鈥�
thought Alice; 鈥淚 might as well be at school at once.鈥� However, she got
up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster
Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came
very queer indeed:鈥�

鈥溾€橳is the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,
鈥淵ou have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.鈥�
As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.鈥�

[later editions continued as follows
When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,
And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,
But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,
His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]


鈥淭hat鈥檚 different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child,鈥� said
the Gryphon.

鈥淲ell, I never heard it before,鈥� said the Mock Turtle; 鈥渂ut it sounds
uncommon nonsense.鈥�

Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,
wondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again.

鈥淚 should like to have it explained,鈥� said the Mock Turtle.

鈥淪he can鈥檛 explain it,鈥� said the Gryphon hastily. 鈥淕o on with the next
verse.鈥�

鈥淏ut about his toes?鈥� the Mock Turtle persisted. 鈥淗ow _could_ he turn
them out with his nose, you know?鈥�

鈥淚t鈥檚 the first position in dancing.鈥� Alice said; but was dreadfully
puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.

鈥淕o on with the next verse,鈥� the Gryphon repeated impatiently: 鈥渋t
begins 鈥榑I passed by his garden_.鈥欌€�

Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come
wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:鈥�

鈥淚 passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie鈥斺€�

[later editions continued as follows
The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,
While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.
When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,
Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:
While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,
And concluded the banquet鈥擼


鈥淲hat _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff,鈥� the Mock Turtle
interrupted, 鈥渋f you don鈥檛 explain it as you go on? It鈥檚 by far the
most confusing thing _I_ ever heard!鈥�

鈥淵es, I think you鈥檇 better leave off,鈥� said the Gryphon: and Alice was
only too glad to do so.

鈥淪hall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?鈥� the Gryphon
went on. 鈥淥r would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?鈥�

鈥淥h, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,鈥� Alice
replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,
鈥淗m! No accounting for tastes! Sing her 鈥榑Turtle Soup_,鈥� will you, old
fellow?鈥�

The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked
with sobs, to sing this:鈥�

鈥淏eautiful Soup, so rich and green,
Waiting in a hot tureen!
Who for such dainties would not stoop?
Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
    Beau鈥攐otiful Soo鈥攐op!
    Beau鈥攐otiful Soo鈥攐op!
Soo鈥攐op of the e鈥攅鈥攅vening,
    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!

鈥淏eautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,
Game, or any other dish?
Who would not give all else for two p

鈥淐horus again!鈥� cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun
to repeat it, when a cry of 鈥淭he trial鈥檚 beginning!鈥� was heard in the
distance.

鈥淐ome on!鈥� cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried
off, without waiting for the end of the song.

鈥淲hat trial is it?鈥� Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only
answered 鈥淐ome on!鈥� and ran the faster, while more and more faintly
came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:鈥�

鈥淪oo鈥攐op of the e鈥攅鈥攅vening,
    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!鈥�




CHAPTER XI.
Who Stole the Tarts?


The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they
arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them鈥攁ll sorts of little
birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was
standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard
him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one
hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the
court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so
good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them鈥斺€淚 wish they鈥檇
get the trial done,鈥� she thought, 鈥渁nd hand round the refreshments!鈥�
But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at
everything about her, to pass away the time.

Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read
about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew
the name of nearly everything there. 鈥淭hat鈥檚 the judge,鈥� she said to
herself, 鈥渂ecause of his great wig.鈥�

The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the
wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he
did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.

鈥淎nd that鈥檚 the jury-box,鈥� thought Alice, 鈥渁nd those twelve creatures,鈥�
(she was obliged to say 鈥渃reatures,鈥� you see, because some of them were
animals, and some were birds,) 鈥淚 suppose they are the jurors.鈥� She
said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather
proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little
girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, 鈥渏ury-men鈥�
would have done just as well.

The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. 鈥淲hat are
they doing?鈥� Alice whispered to the Gryphon. 鈥淭hey can鈥檛 have anything
to put down yet, before the trial鈥檚 begun.鈥�

鈥淭hey鈥檙e putting down their names,鈥� the Gryphon whispered in reply,
鈥渇or fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.鈥�

鈥淪tupid things!鈥� Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she
stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, 鈥淪ilence in the
court!鈥� and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round,
to make out who was talking.

Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,
that all the jurors were writing down 鈥渟tupid things!鈥� on their slates,
and she could even make out that one of them didn鈥檛 know how to spell
鈥渟tupid,鈥� and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. 鈥淎 nice
muddle their slates鈥檒l be in before the trial鈥檚 over!鈥� thought Alice.

One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice
could _not_ stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and
very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly
that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out
at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he
was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this
was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.

鈥淗erald, read the accusation!鈥� said the King.

On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then
unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:鈥�

鈥淭he Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
    All on a summer day:
The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,
    And took them quite away!鈥�


鈥淐onsider your verdict,鈥� the King said to the jury.

鈥淣ot yet, not yet!鈥� the Rabbit hastily interrupted. 鈥淭here鈥檚 a great
deal to come before that!鈥�

鈥淐all the first witness,鈥� said the King; and the White Rabbit blew
three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, 鈥淔irst witness!鈥�

The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand
and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. 鈥淚 beg pardon, your
Majesty,鈥� he began, 鈥渇or bringing these in: but I hadn鈥檛 quite finished
my tea when I was sent for.鈥�

鈥淵ou ought to have finished,鈥� said the King. 鈥淲hen did you begin?鈥�

The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the
court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. 鈥淔ourteenth of March, I _think_ it
was,鈥� he said.

鈥淔ifteenth,鈥� said the March Hare.

鈥淪ixteenth,鈥� added the Dormouse.

鈥淲rite that down,鈥� the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly
wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and
reduced the answer to shillings and pence.

鈥淭ake off your hat,鈥� the King said to the Hatter.

鈥淚t isn鈥檛 mine,鈥� said the Hatter.

鈥淿Stolen!_鈥� the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made
a memorandum of the fact.

鈥淚 keep them to sell,鈥� the Hatter added as an explanation; 鈥淚鈥檝e none
of my own. I鈥檓 a hatter.鈥�

Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,
who turned pale and fidgeted.

鈥淕ive your evidence,鈥� said the King; 鈥渁nd don鈥檛 be nervous, or I鈥檒l
have you executed on the spot.鈥�

This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting
from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his
confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the
bread-and-butter.

Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled
her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to
grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave
the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was
as long as there was room for her.

鈥淚 wish you wouldn鈥檛 squeeze so.鈥� said the Dormouse, who was sitting
next to her. 鈥淚 can hardly breathe.鈥�

鈥淚 can鈥檛 help it,鈥� said Alice very meekly: 鈥淚鈥檓 growing.鈥�

鈥淵ou鈥檝e no right to grow _here_,鈥� said the Dormouse.

鈥淒on鈥檛 talk nonsense,鈥� said Alice more boldly: 鈥測ou know you鈥檙e growing
too.鈥�

鈥淵es, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace,鈥� said the Dormouse: 鈥渘ot in
that ridiculous fashion.鈥� And he got up very sulkily and crossed over
to the other side of the court.

All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,
just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers
of the court, 鈥淏ring me the list of the singers in the last concert!鈥�
on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes
off.

鈥淕ive your evidence,鈥� the King repeated angrily, 鈥渙r I鈥檒l have you
executed, whether you鈥檙e nervous or not.鈥�

鈥淚鈥檓 a poor man, your Majesty,鈥� the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,
鈥溾€攁nd I hadn鈥檛 begun my tea鈥攏ot above a week or so鈥攁nd what with the
bread-and-butter getting so thin鈥攁nd the twinkling of the tea鈥斺€�

鈥淭he twinkling of the _what?_鈥� said the King.

鈥淚t _began_ with the tea,鈥� the Hatter replied.

鈥淥f course twinkling begins with a T!鈥� said the King sharply. 鈥淒o you
take me for a dunce? Go on!鈥�

鈥淚鈥檓 a poor man,鈥� the Hatter went on, 鈥渁nd most things twinkled after
that鈥攐nly the March Hare said鈥斺€�

鈥淚 didn鈥檛!鈥� the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.

鈥淵ou did!鈥� said the Hatter.

鈥淚 deny it!鈥� said the March Hare.

鈥淗e denies it,鈥� said the King: 鈥渓eave out that part.鈥�

鈥淲ell, at any rate, the Dormouse said鈥斺€� the Hatter went on, looking
anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied
nothing, being fast asleep.

鈥淎fter that,鈥� continued the Hatter, 鈥淚 cut some more bread-and-butter鈥斺€�

鈥淏ut what did the Dormouse say?鈥� one of the jury asked.

鈥淭hat I can鈥檛 remember,鈥� said the Hatter.

鈥淵ou _must_ remember,鈥� remarked the King, 鈥渙r I鈥檒l have you executed.鈥�

The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went
down on one knee. 鈥淚鈥檓 a poor man, your Majesty,鈥� he began.

鈥淵ou鈥檙e a _very_ poor _speaker_,鈥� said the King.

Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by
the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just
explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied
up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,
head first, and then sat upon it.)

鈥淚鈥檓 glad I鈥檝e seen that done,鈥� thought Alice. 鈥淚鈥檝e so often read in
the newspapers, at the end of trials, 鈥淭here was some attempts at
applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the
court,鈥� and I never understood what it meant till now.鈥�

鈥淚f that鈥檚 all you know about it, you may stand down,鈥� continued the
King.

鈥淚 can鈥檛 go no lower,鈥� said the Hatter: 鈥淚鈥檓 on the floor, as it is.鈥�

鈥淭hen you may _sit_ down,鈥� the King replied.

Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.

鈥淐ome, that finished the guinea-pigs!鈥� thought Alice. 鈥淣ow we shall get
on better.鈥�

鈥淚鈥檇 rather finish my tea,鈥� said the Hatter, with an anxious look at
the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.

鈥淵ou may go,鈥� said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,
without even waiting to put his shoes on.

鈥溾€攁nd just take his head off outside,鈥� the Queen added to one of the
officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get
to the door.

鈥淐all the next witness!鈥� said the King.

The next witness was the Duchess鈥檚 cook. She carried the pepper-box in
her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the
court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.

鈥淕ive your evidence,鈥� said the King.

鈥淪han鈥檛,鈥� said the cook.

The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,
鈥淵our Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.鈥�

鈥淲ell, if I must, I must,鈥� the King said, with a melancholy air, and,
after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were
nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, 鈥淲hat are tarts made of?鈥�

鈥淧epper, mostly,鈥� said the cook.

鈥淭reacle,鈥� said a sleepy voice behind her.

鈥淐ollar that Dormouse,鈥� the Queen shrieked out. 鈥淏ehead that Dormouse!
Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his
whiskers!鈥�

For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse
turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had
disappeared.

鈥淣ever mind!鈥� said the King, with an air of great relief. 鈥淐all the
next witness.鈥� And he added in an undertone to the Queen, 鈥淩eally, my
dear, _you_ must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my
forehead ache!鈥�

Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling
very curious to see what the next witness would be like, 鈥溾€攆or they
haven鈥檛 got much evidence _yet_,鈥� she said to herself. Imagine her
surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill
little voice, the name 鈥淎lice!鈥�




CHAPTER XII.
Alice鈥檚 Evidence


鈥淗ere!鈥� cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how
large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such
a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,
upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there
they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of
goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.

鈥淥h, I _beg_ your pardon!鈥� she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and
began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident
of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of
idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the
jury-box, or they would die.

鈥淭he trial cannot proceed,鈥� said the King in a very grave voice, 鈥渦ntil
all the jurymen are back in their proper places鈥擾all_,鈥� he repeated
with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.

Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put
the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its
tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon
got it out again, and put it right; 鈥渘ot that it signifies much,鈥� she
said to herself; 鈥淚 should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the
trial one way up as the other.鈥�

As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being
upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to
them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the
accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do
anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the
court.

鈥淲hat do you know about this business?鈥� the King said to Alice.

鈥淣othing,鈥� said Alice.

鈥淣othing _whatever?_鈥� persisted the King.

鈥淣othing whatever,鈥� said Alice.

鈥淭hat鈥檚 very important,鈥� the King said, turning to the jury. They were
just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White
Rabbit interrupted: 鈥淿Un_important, your Majesty means, of course,鈥� he
said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as
he spoke.

鈥淿Un_important, of course, I meant,鈥� the King hastily said, and went on
to himself in an undertone,

鈥渋mportant鈥攗nimportant鈥攗nimportant鈥攊mportant鈥斺€� as if he were trying
which word sounded best.

Some of the jury wrote it down 鈥渋mportant,鈥� and some 鈥渦nimportant.鈥�
Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;
鈥渂ut it doesn鈥檛 matter a bit,鈥� she thought to herself.

At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in
his note-book, cackled out 鈥淪ilence!鈥� and read out from his book, 鈥淩ule
Forty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.鈥�

Everybody looked at Alice.

鈥淿I鈥檓_ not a mile high,鈥� said Alice.

鈥淵ou are,鈥� said the King.

鈥淣early two miles high,鈥� added the Queen.

鈥淲ell, I shan鈥檛 go, at any rate,鈥� said Alice: 鈥渂esides, that鈥檚 not a
regular rule: you invented it just now.鈥�

鈥淚t鈥檚 the oldest rule in the book,鈥� said the King.

鈥淭hen it ought to be Number One,鈥� said Alice.

The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. 鈥淐onsider your
verdict,鈥� he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.

鈥淭here鈥檚 more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,鈥� said the
White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; 鈥渢his paper has just been
picked up.鈥�

鈥淲hat鈥檚 in it?鈥� said the Queen.

鈥淚 haven鈥檛 opened it yet,鈥� said the White Rabbit, 鈥渂ut it seems to be a
letter, written by the prisoner to鈥攖o somebody.鈥�

鈥淚t must have been that,鈥� said the King, 鈥渦nless it was written to
nobody, which isn鈥檛 usual, you know.鈥�

鈥淲ho is it directed to?鈥� said one of the jurymen.

鈥淚t isn鈥檛 directed at all,鈥� said the White Rabbit; 鈥渋n fact, there鈥檚
nothing written on the _outside_.鈥� He unfolded the paper as he spoke,
and added 鈥淚t isn鈥檛 a letter, after all: it鈥檚 a set of verses.鈥�

鈥淎re they in the prisoner鈥檚 handwriting?鈥� asked another of the jurymen.

鈥淣o, they鈥檙e not,鈥� said the White Rabbit, 鈥渁nd that鈥檚 the queerest
thing about it.鈥� (The jury all looked puzzled.)

鈥淗e must have imitated somebody else鈥檚 hand,鈥� said the King. (The jury
all brightened up again.)

鈥淧lease your Majesty,鈥� said the Knave, 鈥淚 didn鈥檛 write it, and they
can鈥檛 prove I did: there鈥檚 no name signed at the end.鈥�

鈥淚f you didn鈥檛 sign it,鈥� said the King, 鈥渢hat only makes the matter
worse. You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else you鈥檇 have signed
your name like an honest man.鈥�

There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really
clever thing the King had said that day.

鈥淭hat _proves_ his guilt,鈥� said the Queen.

鈥淚t proves nothing of the sort!鈥� said Alice. 鈥淲hy, you don鈥檛 even know
what they鈥檙e about!鈥�

鈥淩ead them,鈥� said the King.

The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. 鈥淲here shall I begin, please
your Majesty?鈥� he asked.

鈥淏egin at the beginning,鈥� the King said gravely, 鈥渁nd go on till you
come to the end: then stop.鈥�

These were the verses the White Rabbit read:鈥�

鈥淭hey told me you had been to her,
    And mentioned me to him:
She gave me a good character,
    But said I could not swim.

He sent them word I had not gone
    (We know it to be true):
If she should push the matter on,
    What would become of you?

I gave her one, they gave him two,
    You gave us three or more;
They all returned from him to you,
    Though they were mine before.

If I or she should chance to be
    Involved in this affair,
He trusts to you to set them free,
    Exactly as we were.

My notion was that you had been
    (Before she had this fit)
An obstacle that came between
    Him, and ourselves, and it.

Don鈥檛 let him know she liked them best,
    For this must ever be
A secret, kept from all the rest,
    Between yourself and me.鈥�


鈥淭hat鈥檚 the most important piece of evidence we鈥檝e heard yet,鈥� said the
King, rubbing his hands; 鈥渟o now let the jury鈥斺€�

鈥淚f any one of them can explain it,鈥� said Alice, (she had grown so
large in the last few minutes that she wasn鈥檛 a bit afraid of
interrupting him,) 鈥淚鈥檒l give him sixpence. _I_ don鈥檛 believe there鈥檚
an atom of meaning in it.鈥�

The jury all wrote down on their slates, 鈥淿She_ doesn鈥檛 believe there鈥檚
an atom of meaning in it,鈥� but none of them attempted to explain the
paper.

鈥淚f there鈥檚 no meaning in it,鈥� said the King, 鈥渢hat saves a world of
trouble, you know, as we needn鈥檛 try to find any. And yet I don鈥檛
know,鈥� he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at
them with one eye; 鈥淚 seem to see some meaning in them, after all.
鈥溾€擾said I could not swim_鈥斺€� you can鈥檛 swim, can you?鈥� he added, turning
to the Knave.

The Knave shook his head sadly. 鈥淒o I look like it?鈥� he said. (Which he
certainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard.)

鈥淎ll right, so far,鈥� said the King, and he went on muttering over the
verses to himself: 鈥溾€榑We know it to be true_鈥斺€� that鈥檚 the jury, of
course鈥斺€榑I gave her one, they gave him two_鈥斺€� why, that must be what he
did with the tarts, you know鈥斺€�

鈥淏ut, it goes on 鈥榑they all returned from him to you_,鈥欌€� said Alice.

鈥淲hy, there they are!鈥� said the King triumphantly, pointing to the
tarts on the table. 鈥淣othing can be clearer than _that_. Then
again鈥斺€榑before she had this fit_鈥斺€� you never had fits, my dear, I
think?鈥� he said to the Queen.

鈥淣ever!鈥� said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard
as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his
slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily
began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long
as it lasted.)

鈥淭hen the words don鈥檛 _fit_ you,鈥� said the King, looking round the
court with a smile. There was a dead silence.

鈥淚t鈥檚 a pun!鈥� the King added in an offended tone, and everybody
laughed, 鈥淟et the jury consider their verdict,鈥� the King said, for
about the twentieth time that day.

鈥淣o, no!鈥� said the Queen. 鈥淪entence first鈥攙erdict afterwards.鈥�

鈥淪tuff and nonsense!鈥� said Alice loudly. 鈥淭he idea of having the
sentence first!鈥�

鈥淗old your tongue!鈥� said the Queen, turning purple.

鈥淚 won鈥檛!鈥� said Alice.

鈥淥ff with her head!鈥� the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody
moved.

鈥淲ho cares for you?鈥� said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by
this time.) 鈥淵ou鈥檙e nothing but a pack of cards!鈥�

At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon
her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and
tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her
head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead
leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.

鈥淲ake up, Alice dear!鈥� said her sister; 鈥淲hy, what a long sleep you鈥檝e
had!鈥�

鈥淥h, I鈥檝e had such a curious dream!鈥� said Alice, and she told her
sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange
Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she
had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, 鈥淚t _was_ a curious
dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it鈥檚 getting late.鈥�
So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,
what a wonderful dream it had been.


But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her
hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all
her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,
and this was her dream:鈥�

First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny
hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were
looking up into hers鈥攕he could hear the very tones of her voice, and
see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair
that _would_ always get into her eyes鈥攁nd still as she listened, or
seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the
strange creatures of her little sister鈥檚 dream.

The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by鈥攖he
frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool鈥攕he
could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends
shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen
ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution鈥攐nce more the pig-baby
was sneezing on the Duchess鈥檚 knee, while plates and dishes crashed
around it鈥攐nce more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the
Lizard鈥檚 slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,
filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock
Turtle.

So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all
would change to dull reality鈥攖he grass would be only rustling in the
wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds鈥攖he rattling
teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen鈥檚 shrill
cries to the voice of the shepherd boy鈥攁nd the sneeze of the baby, the
shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change
(she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard鈥攚hile the
lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock
Turtle鈥檚 heavy sobs.

Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers
would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would
keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her
childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children,
and make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,
perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she
would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all
their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer
days.

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
